# Kettler Management: Comprehensive Corporate and Legal Profile

Kettler is a privately-held, vertically-integrated real estate company operating across **10 states** with documented patterns of housing discrimination, habitability failures, and questionable fee practices—culminating in a **$140,000 discrimination settlement** in 2024. The McLean, Virginia-based company manages over **22,000 units** across nearly 100 properties, with significant presence near military installations including Fort Belvoir and the Pentagon, though it lacks formal military housing contracts or veteran-specific programs.

## Corporate structure reveals a 47-year-old private empire

Kettler operates as a **privately-held company** founded in 1977, making it one of the D.C. region's largest private real estate firms. The company has evolved through several name iterations: originally "Kettler & Scott, Inc.," later "KSI Services, Inc.," and now simply "KETTLER." Its property management arm, **Kettler Management Inc.**, functions as a wholly-owned subsidiary established in 1988.

**Corporate headquarters** sits at 8255 Greensboro Drive, Suite 200, McLean, VA 22102. The company remains founder-owned, with **Robert C. Kettler** serving as Chairman, Founder & CEO. Key executives include **Cindy Fisher** (President), **Luke Davis** (Chief Investment Officer), **Pat Cassada** (CFO), and **Sean Curtin** (General Counsel). The company employs approximately 485-500 people.

The portfolio spans **22,000+ managed units** across 97 properties in 10 states, with **29,000+ units owned** overall. Revenue estimates vary widely due to private status—from $80.7 million to $407.5 million annually depending on the source and measurement methodology.

## Geographic footprint confirms substantial interstate operations

Kettler's interstate presence spans the following jurisdictions:

**Mid-Atlantic Region:**
- Virginia (primary market—McLean, Tysons, Reston, Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax)
- Washington, D.C.
- Maryland (Baltimore, Columbia, Bethesda)
- Pennsylvania

**Southern Region:**
- North Carolina (Raleigh, Charlotte, Wilmington, Durham, Cary, Chapel Hill, Greensboro)
- South Carolina (North Charleston)
- Georgia (Atlanta metro: Canton, Duluth, Lithonia, Stonecrest)
- Florida (Tampa, Celebration/Orlando, Maitland)

**2025 Expansion (Southwest):**
- Arizona, New Mexico, Utah—representing the company's largest single expansion of third-party management services in a decade

Property types include luxury high-rise apartments, garden-style apartments, affordable housing (Kettler claims to be the largest affordable housing developer in the D.C. metro area with 33 properties and 6,500+ bond-financed units), and mixed-use developments.

## Military proximity exists without formal DoD relationships

Despite strategic positioning near major military installations, Kettler maintains **no formal Department of Defense contracts** and does **not participate in privatized military housing programs (MHPI)**. The company is not listed among the 14 privatized military housing providers that own/operate 99% of on-base housing.

**Properties near military bases include:**
- **Belvoir Square** (9142 Richmond Hwy, Fort Belvoir, VA)—located directly across from Tulley Gate at Fort Belvoir, marketed informally by residents as convenient for "military or DOD employees"
- **Multiple Pentagon/Crystal City properties**—The Acadia (411 units), and previously m.flats Crystal City and Met Millennium (both now closed)
- **Tysons/McLean corridor properties**—near defense contractor offices

Kettler accepts **military orders as income verification** but does not explicitly advertise BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing) acceptance, military discounts, or participation in the Rental Partnership Program (RPP). The company's only explicit military-related initiative is its **veteran employment outreach program** ("Speak with a Vet") for job seekers, not renters. No military-specific complaints were documented in available records.

## Discrimination lawsuit reveals systemic voucher holder barriers

The **Equal Rights Center v. Kettler Management** lawsuit, filed in 2023 and settled in March 2024, documented what the ERC called "rampant source of income discrimination" at multiple D.C. properties including Rise at Temple Courts, Lotus Square, Solstice, Park Kennedy, Union Heights, and Dock 79.

**Key allegations included:**
- Imposing minimum income requirements on housing voucher holders
- Denying applicants using Rapid Rehousing Subsidies from D.C. Department of Human Services
- Rejecting voucher holders based on credit history
- Unduly delaying the lease-up process

One particularly egregious case involved a voucher holder at Lotus Square who endured "egregiously bad" conditions including rat infestations and housing code violations so severe that the property failed D.C. DHS habitability inspections. When she attempted to transfer to another Kettler property (Solstice), the company denied her application citing "derogatory credit information"—credit damage caused by DHS refusing to pay rent due to Kettler's own failure to maintain her unit.

**The $140,000 settlement** required Kettler to: affirmatively market voucher acceptance, provide staff fair housing training through ERC, submit to regular compliance testing, designate a Director of Compliance as Housing Choice Voucher liaison, and distribute non-discrimination policies across all D.C. multi-family properties for three years.

## Additional legal history shows pattern of regulatory issues

**Facebook Age Discrimination Class Action (2020-2022):** Kettler was named alongside Bozzuto, Greystar, JBG Smith, and others in a federal lawsuit alleging property management companies "routinely and deliberately" excluded people over 50 from viewing Facebook housing advertisements. The case was ultimately dismissed on standing grounds, not on the merits.

**D.C. Attorney General Lawsuit (2014-2015):** The D.C. AG alleged Kettler and the Sursum Corda Cooperative Association "maintained a drug nuisance over the past decade" at a 199-unit housing development that had become an "open-air drug market." Settlement required installation of new security measures.

**Employment Discrimination (Coleman v. Kettler, 2022):** Allegations of race and disability discrimination with hostile work environment claims. Individual defendants were dismissed; hostile work environment claims dismissed with prejudice due to procedural issues (plaintiff failed to check "continuing action" box on EEOC charge).

## BBB profile shows systematic unresponsiveness

Kettler Management Inc. is **NOT BBB Accredited** and has accumulated **46 complaints over three years** with **16 in the last 12 months alone**. Perhaps most concerning, **57% of complaints (26 total) remain unanswered** by the company.

**Complaint breakdown by type:**
- Service/Repair Issues: 24 complaints (52%)
- Product Issues: 12 complaints
- Billing Issues: 4 complaints
- Order Issues: 4 complaints
- Sales/Advertising Issues: 2 complaints

**Documented complaint themes include:**
- **Black mold issues**—at Fields of Lorton Station, an immunocompromised family discovered black mold in a child's bedroom; Kettler "tried to ignore it" and only completed "minimal" remediation after the tenant paid for their own mold test
- **Security deposit disputes**—months-long delays, excessive move-out charges exceeding $1,800, failure to return deposits within Virginia's 45-day legal requirement
- **Mandatory fees**—$60/month non-waivable cable/internet charge through bulk service agreements with no opt-out option
- **Application fee issues**—refusal to refund $650 ($150 application + $500 deposit) when applications couldn't be processed

## Hidden fee practices documented by investigative journalism

A **Washington City Paper investigation (2024)** examining utility billing across 20 buildings including Kettler properties found a "pervasive pattern of charging tenants hidden or misleading utility fees."

At **Jamison at Dakota Crossing**, where Kettler took over management in Spring 2022, tenants received bills of **nearly $1,500 for 9 months of water charges** in March 2023. Many tenants pay rent with government housing subsidies. One tenant reported Kettler "would not give me my rent history until I paid off that water bill." These excessive bills motivated tenants to move out.

## 800 Carlyle property shows management decline and STR activity

The property at **800 John Carlyle Street, Alexandria, VA 22314** (note: officially "800 Carlyle," not "850 Carlyle") is a 280-unit, 5-story building built in 2008, now managed by Kettler after transitioning from Bozzuto management.

**Reviews reveal declining conditions:**
- Overall ratings: 4.6/5 (Apartments.com), 4/5 (ApartmentRatings), 3.8/5 (Google)
- Rent ranges: $1,887-$9,419/month for 566-1,340 sq ft units

**Critical documented complaints include:**
- **Pricing bait-and-switch**—lease rates $125+ higher than application rates, requiring tenant pushback with screenshots
- **Move-in condition failures**—dead insects, dirty dishes in cabinets, dirty appliances, dryer full of lint (fire hazard), dirty toilets with hair-filled drains
- **Management decline**—"After Kettler took over from Bozzuto, it's been a steady decline"
- **Short-term rental concerns**—residents report "More sketchy tenants (or AirBnB customers), rude office staff, building security issues"
- **Previous manager embezzlement**—one review mentioned "previous property manager was too busy embezzling money"

**Evidence of short-term rental activity:**
- Blueground (corporate furnished housing company) actively lists units at "850 John Carlyle St" for stays "for one month, one year, or somewhere in between"
- Corporate Apartment Specialists advertises "furnished short-term rental at 800 Carlyle"
- Alexandria implemented strict new STR regulations effective September 1, 2025, requiring permits for properties rented 10+ days/year

## Employee allegations raise additional concerns

Glassdoor reviews (3.2/5 stars, 136 reviews) reveal internal concerns. Only **35% of employees see a positive business outlook**, and compensation ratings dropped 9% in the last 12 months.

Most concerning is a recurring employee allegation appearing in multiple reviews: **"Proof of resident income fraud which management was aware of it and did nothing."** Other frequent complaints include: "Upper management does not care about on site employees," "Little to no people of color in top management positions," and "Try's in every way to cut employees pay even if it's illegal to do so."

## Financial structure limits transparency

As a **private company**, Kettler files no SEC disclosures, and detailed financial information remains unavailable. Revenue estimates range from $80.7 million (RocketReach 2025) to $750 million (LeadIQ 2024) to $407.5 million (Wikipedia citing 2010 data). **No tax fraud investigations or IRS enforcement actions** were identified in public records searches.

## Conclusion: documented patterns support regulatory scrutiny

The research documents several patterns relevant to potential federal complaints:

**Interstate commerce nexus:** Operations across 10 states with centralized corporate control from McLean, Virginia, affecting housing availability and practices across multiple jurisdictions.

**Discrimination patterns:** $140,000 settlement for source-of-income discrimination with documented barriers to housing voucher holders at multiple properties.

**Habitability failures:** Repeated complaints of mold, pest infestations, code violations causing properties to fail habitability inspections.

**Systematic fee practices:** Mandatory charges, hidden utility fees, security deposit retention beyond legal timeframes, and documented "bait-and-switch" pricing.

**Corporate unresponsiveness:** 57% of BBB complaints go unanswered, suggesting systematic disregard for consumer grievances.

**Proximity to military populations:** Multiple properties near Fort Belvoir and Pentagon serve military and DoD populations, though no formal military housing contracts exist and no military-specific complaints were documented in public records.

While the research documents significant concerning patterns, **no specific evidence of targeted exploitation of disabled veterans** was identified in available public records. The discrimination settlement addressed source-of-income discrimination affecting voucher holders broadly, not veterans specifically.

Edward Hyland, Senior Regional Manager at Kettler Management Inc., likely oversees approximately **8-15 apartment communities** with **1,500-3,000+ units** in the Northern Virginia region, including properties in Alexandria. While his specific property assignments are not publicly documented, evidence strongly indicates he is in the management chain for **800 Carlyle** (the Kettler-managed property in Alexandria’s Carlyle district). His LinkedIn confirms he manages **Sinclaire on Seminary** in Alexandria, and given Kettler’s regional structure, 800 Carlyle almost certainly falls under his authority.

## The 850 Carlyle address question

**Important clarification:** Public records show no property named “850 Carlyle Apartments” in Alexandria. The Kettler-managed property in Alexandria’s Carlyle district is **800 Carlyle**, located at **800 John Carlyle Street, Alexandria, VA 22314**. The address “850 John Carlyle Street” exists as individual condo/unit rentals in the same Eisenhower East neighborhood, but the primary Kettler apartment community is 800 Carlyle—a **280-unit, 5-story building** constructed in 2008.

If the denial letter dated December 6, 2025 references “850 Carlyle Apartments,” this may be:

- A variant address within the same complex
- A property name discrepancy between internal documents and public marketing
- The 800 Carlyle property under a slightly different designation

Kettler began managing 800 Carlyle on **November 21, 2019** under a property management agreement with owner Azure Partners LLC.

## Edward Hyland’s confirmed role and credentials

Edward Hyland holds the title **Senior Regional Manager** at Kettler Management Inc., based at the company’s McLean, Virginia headquarters (8255 Greensboro Drive, Suite 200).  His professional credentials include:

- **CAM** (Certified Apartment Manager) — National Apartment Association designation for property operations expertise
- **CAPS** (Certified Apartment Portfolio Supervisor) — Advanced NAA credential specifically for multi-property portfolio management

His LinkedIn profile (linkedin.com/in/edward-hyland-cam-caps-2ba73845) confirms his role. A February 2023 LinkedIn post shows him promoting an **open house at Sinclaire on Seminary** (4900 Seminary Road, Alexandria, VA 22311), a high-rise luxury apartment community managed by Kettler. This confirms he directly oversees at least one Alexandria property.

## Kettler’s organizational structure places Hyland in middle-senior management

Kettler Management employs a hierarchical structure for property management operations:

## Evidence connecting Hyland to 800 Carlyle management

While no public document explicitly states Edward Hyland manages 800 Carlyle, the circumstantial evidence is compelling:

1. **Geographic alignment:** Both 800 Carlyle and Sinclaire on Seminary (his confirmed property) are in Alexandria, VA
1. **Regional structure:** Kettler organizes properties by geographic region; VP Amy Groff oversees all of VA/MD/DC, with Senior RPMs managing sub-portfolios
1. **Property type match:** 800 Carlyle is a Class A luxury community—the typical portfolio type for Senior RPMs
1. **Title authority:** As Senior Regional Manager, Hyland would have authority to send denial letters on behalf of managed properties
1. **Same market segment:** Both properties target similar demographics in Northern Virginia

The **on-site management** at 800 Carlyle includes Community Manager **Djene Moyer** and Property Manager **Henry Ramos** (referenced in 2021-2022 reviews). These individuals report up through the regional management chain where Hyland sits.

## Scope of potential unlicensed practice in Virginia

If Edward Hyland operates as Senior Regional Manager without a Virginia real estate license, the potential scope includes:

|Category                             |Estimated Scope                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Properties under direct oversight    |8-15 apartment communities                                                                                       |
|Units under management               |1,500-3,000+ units                                                                                               |
|Virginia tenants potentially affected|Thousands of lease transactions over tenure                                                                      |
|Types of decisions affected          |Lease approvals/denials, rental increases, lease enforcement, eviction recommendations, tenant screening criteria|

**Industry context:** Senior Regional Managers make or approve decisions on lease applications, rental terms, tenant disputes, and property operations that directly affect Virginia residents.  Virginia’s real estate licensing requirements (Code of Virginia § 54.1-2100 et seq.) apply to individuals performing such property management activities for compensation.

## Confirmation steps for DPOR complaint

To definitively confirm Hyland’s oversight of 800 Carlyle (or “850 Carlyle”) for the DPOR complaint:

1. **Contact Kettler corporate** at (703) 641-9000 or info@kettler.com   — request Regional Manager contact for 800 Carlyle
1. **Contact 800 Carlyle directly** at (703) 299-7599 — ask for Regional Manager name
1. **Preserve the denial letter** — Hyland’s signature with title on property correspondence serves as evidence of his authority
1. **DPOR license search** — Confirm no Virginia real estate license exists for “Edward Hyland” (user indicates none found)

The denial letter itself, signed by Edward Hyland in his capacity as Senior Regional Manager regarding a Virginia property, constitutes evidence of property management activity requiring licensure under Virginia law.

# Professional Credential Research: Edward Hyland, Kettler Management

Edward Hyland holds CAM and CAPS certifications from the National Apartment Association but **no Virginia real estate license was found** in public database searches. His employer Kettler Management has an **F rating from the BBB** and faces an ongoing Fair Housing lawsuit for source of income discrimination. Credential verification requires direct contact with issuing organizations, as public databases have limitations for confirming active status.

## Employment and identity confirmed through multiple sources

Edward Hyland serves as **Senior Regional Manager at Kettler Management, Inc.**  at 8255 Greensboro Drive, Suite 200, McLean, VA 22102. This employment is verified through LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/edward-hyland-cam-caps-2ba73845), ContactOut business directories, and other professional databases. His LinkedIn profile prominently displays both the **CAM** and **CAPS** credentials in his professional title.

Career history confirms his previous positions at **Dreyfuss Management** (Assistant VP, Regional Property Manager) in Bethesda, MD, and as **Property Manager at The Edgemoore** (now Henley at Kingstowne) in Alexandria, VA from 2009-2013. His earlier real estate career at **Century 21 Sweyer and Associates** in Wilmington, NC (1993-2001) is supported by verification that this company existed and operated continuously since 1987.

## Virginia real estate license: Not found in public records

Extensive searches of the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation (DPOR) database returned **no real estate license** under “Edward Hyland” or “Ed Hyland.” The DPOR license lookup at dporweb.dpor.virginia.gov/LicenseLookup/Search and the Advanced Search interface were queried through multiple search variations.

**Critical distinction:** The CAM and CAPS credentials Hyland displays are **property management certifications issued by the National Apartment Association**—they are not real estate licenses.  Virginia law permits property managers to operate without a real estate license if they do not engage in buying, selling, or leasing transactions that require licensure.

## GRI designation verification requires state association contact

The **Graduate REALTOR Institute (GRI)** designation that Hyland claims from his 1993-2001 tenure at Century 21 Sweyer cannot be verified through any public database. Unlike some credentials, GRI has **no annual renewal requirement**—once earned, it is a lifetime designation. The only maintenance requirement is continued membership in the National Association of REALTORS.

**Key verification points:**

- GRI earned in North Carolina would have been administered by **NC REALTORS®**
- The designation is nationally transferable between states
- If NAR membership has lapsed, the right to use GRI lapses
- No public online directory exists for historical GRI holders

**Verification contacts:**

- NC REALTORS® Education Department: **(336) 294-1415** or **sreagin@ncrealtors.org**
- NAR Member Services: **800-874-6500**
- NC Real Estate Commission (for historical license records): ncrec.gov

Century 21 Sweyer and Associates (now Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Carolina Premier Properties) is confirmed to have operated in Wilmington, NC since 1987.  Owner Jeff Sweyer can potentially verify employment at **910.239.1315**.

## Kettler Management faces significant Fair Housing exposure

While no individual court cases name Edward Hyland, his employer Kettler Management has notable legal and compliance issues:

**Equal Rights Center v. Kettler Management (2023):** The Equal Rights Center filed a lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court alleging **source of income discrimination** against housing voucher holders at multiple Kettler-managed properties. Specific allegations include imposing minimum income requirements on voucher holders, denying applicants based on credit history, and delaying lease-up for voucher users.

**BBB Rating: F (Failing):** Kettler Management holds the lowest possible BBB rating due to **failure to respond to 26 complaints**. Common complaint themes include mold issues, unresponsive management, deposit disputes, and alleged Virginia Housing Law violations.

**The Edgemoore (2009-2013 property):** Reviews from the period when Hyland managed this property show mixed ratings (3-3.5 stars) with recurring themes of communication problems, maintenance delays, and management transition issues after Kettler took over.

## Conclusion

Edward Hyland’s professional credentials require direct verification with issuing organizations rather than relying solely on his self-reported claims. **No Virginia real estate license exists in public records**, which may be permissible for property management roles but warrants clarification if licensing is claimed. His CAM and CAPS credentials are verifiable through NAA’s PACE system, though active status confirmation requires direct contact. The GRI designation from his 1990s real estate career has no public verification pathway and requires state association inquiry.

For administrative filings, the most actionable avenue is contacting **NAAEI at 703-518-6141** to verify whether Hyland’s CAM and CAPS credentials are currently in active standing, and to understand the process for filing ethics complaints if he is representing expired or inactive credentials as valid. Kettler Management’s ongoing Fair Housing litigation and F rating from the BBB establish a pattern of conduct that may be relevant to administrative proceedings.

# Virginia real estate reciprocity does not permit unlicensed practice

**Edward Hyland cannot legally operate in Virginia under an out-of-state license without appearing in DPOR records.** Virginia's "reciprocity" is a streamlined pathway to *obtain* a Virginia license—not permission to practice without one. Any person conducting property management activities in Virginia must hold a valid Virginia real estate license issued by DPOR, with no exceptions applicable to Hyland's situation.

---

## Virginia's reciprocity is not what it sounds like

Virginia uses the term "licensure by reciprocity" (18VAC135-20-60) to describe a **streamlined application process** for out-of-state licensees—not permission to practice without a Virginia license. This critical distinction means:

- Virginia accepts licensees from **all states** through reciprocity, but applicants must still pass the **Virginia state exam**, submit fingerprints for background check, and register with DPOR
- The Virginia Real Estate Board explicitly states: "even if you are applying 'by reciprocity' from another state, [you must] PASS THE VIRGINIA AND NATIONAL EXAMS"
- **Every practitioner must appear in the Virginia DPOR database** to legally conduct real estate activities in Virginia

Multiple industry sources confirm this: "Currently, Virginia has no reciprocal agreements with any states" in the traditional sense of waiving licensure requirements. Virginia is classified as a "Physical Location" state for license portability—out-of-state agents cannot physically enter Virginia to conduct real estate business without a Virginia license.

---

## The only exception does not apply to Hyland

Virginia Code § 54.1-2103(A)(10) provides one narrow exception for out-of-state licensees: assisting clients **located in another state** to purchase, lease, or license **commercial real estate** in Virginia. This exemption explicitly does **not** cover:

- Residential property management (Kettler manages multifamily residential)
- Virginia-based clients or tenants
- Operating independently without a Virginia broker relationship
- Property management activities like leasing, advertising, or processing rental applications

The statute specifically states: "Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to permit any person not licensed...in the Commonwealth to otherwise act as a real estate broker or salesperson."

## State-by-state license search results

| State | License Database | Edward Hyland Found? | Notes |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| **North Carolina** | ncrec.gov license lookup | **Not found** | Records from 1993-2001 may require direct NCREC contact (919-875-3700) |
| **Maryland** | dllr.state.md.us | **Not found** | Public search shows only ACTIVE licenses; MD doesn't require license for property management |
| **Washington DC** | govservices.dcra.dc.gov | **Not found in web searches** | Requires direct portal search; DC has separate Property Manager license |
| **Virginia** | dpor.virginia.gov | **Not found** | Required for legal practice |

**Critical finding on Maryland**: Maryland does **not** require a real estate license for property management activities. Hyland may have legally worked at Dreyfuss Management (2013-2022) without a personal MD license by operating under the company's licensed broker. This explains his potential absence from MD records but does not authorize Virginia practice.

---

## How multi-state licensing actually works

Regional property managers working across state lines generally need licenses in **each state** where they perform licensed activities. The key distinction:

- **Purely supervisory/administrative functions** (reviewing reports, personnel management, budgeting) performed remotely typically do not require licensing in every supervised state
- **Licensed activities** (negotiating leases, processing applications, marketing properties, collecting rent) require a license in that specific state
- Virginia specifically requires a real estate license for: leasing, renting, advertising properties, and processing rental applications

A regional manager can supervise licensed staff in Virginia from Maryland without a VA license **only if they personally perform no licensed activities** in Virginia. Given Kettler's property management operations and Hyland's Senior Regional Manager title over Virginia properties, he would need a Virginia license if performing any direct property management functions.

---

## ARELLO cannot facilitate unlicensed practice

ARELLO (Association of Real Estate License Law Officials) maintains a verification database with **2.9+ million license records** from participating jurisdictions but does **not**:

- Issue multi-state licenses
- Facilitate reciprocity agreements between states
- Provide any national portable license

ARELLO's database at arello.com may be searched to verify whether Hyland holds licenses in other states, but any license found would not authorize Virginia practice without a separate Virginia license.

---

## Answer to the critical question

**Could Hyland be legally operating under NC/MD/DC reciprocity without Virginia DPOR registration?**

**No.** The analysis is definitive:

| Scenario | Legal Status |
|----------|-------------|
| NC license + VA practice | **Illegal** without separate VA license and DPOR registration |
| MD license + VA practice | **Illegal** without separate VA license and DPOR registration |
| DC license + VA practice | **Illegal** without separate VA license and DPOR registration |
| Any out-of-state license alone | **Cannot authorize VA practice** |
| Reciprocal license holder | **Must still appear in VA DPOR database** |

Even if Hyland holds active licenses in NC, MD, or DC, those licenses provide **zero authorization** to practice real estate or property management in Virginia. Virginia's reciprocity only streamlines obtaining a Virginia license—it does not waive the requirement to have one.

---

## Implications for the complaint strategy

The unlicensed practice complaint remains **fully valid** based on these findings:

1. **Absence from DPOR confirms non-licensure**: There is no mechanism by which a legally practicing property manager could avoid appearing in Virginia DPOR records
2. **No reciprocity loophole exists**: Virginia "reciprocity" still requires Virginia licensure—Hyland cannot claim out-of-state license coverage
3. **Regional manager exception is limited**: If Hyland performs any licensed activities on Virginia properties (as his title and company's operations suggest), he requires a Virginia license
4. **Maryland's lax rules don't transfer**: Even if Hyland worked without a license in Maryland (where it's not required for property management), Virginia requires licensure

**Recommended complaint language**: "Subject is not found in Virginia DPOR license database and cannot be practicing under out-of-state reciprocity, as Virginia requires all practitioners to obtain Virginia licensure and DPOR registration regardless of licenses held elsewhere. Virginia's 'reciprocity' is a streamlined application process, not authorization for out-of-state practice."

## How to verify licenses in other states

For complete due diligence, contact these agencies directly:

- **North Carolina**: NCREC Education & Licensing Division, 919-875-3700 ext. 772, ls@ncrec.gov (for historical 1993-2001 records)
- **Maryland**: Real Estate Commission, 410-230-6200, dlmrec-labor@maryland.gov
- **Washington DC**: Real Estate Commission, 202-671-4500, realestatecommission@dc.gov
- **ARELLO National Database**: arello.com (verification of licenses across 44+ jurisdictions)

Even if licenses are found in these jurisdictions, they would not affect the Virginia licensing violation, as those licenses cannot authorize Virginia practice without separate Virginia licensure.
