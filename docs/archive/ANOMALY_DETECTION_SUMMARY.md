# Anomaly Detection Summary

**Date:** December 7, 2025
**Analysis Type:** Comprehensive Anomaly Detection and Consolidation

## Overview

This report summarizes all anomalies found through systematic analysis of the Kettler Management investigation dataset.

## Anomaly Sources Consolidated

1. **New Anomalies Found** - Analysis of current dataset for patterns and gaps
2. **Additional Anomalies** - License patterns, address clustering, data quality issues
3. **Nexus Patterns** - Timeline impossibilities, front person evidence
4. **Timeline Analysis** - Causation patterns, license clustering

## Key Anomalies Identified

### 1. License Verification Gaps (HIGH SEVERITY)
- **Djene Moyer** - Needs Property Management License verification
- **Henry Ramos** - Needs Property Management License verification
- **Sean Curtin** - Needs State Bar Admission verification
- **Status:** All DPOR searches are frameworks - actual searches not performed

### 2. Timeline Impossibilities (CRITICAL)
- **8 firms licensed BEFORE principal broker** (Skidmore licensed 2025-05-30)
- Firms cannot have principal broker who wasn't licensed when firm was established
- **Average license gap: 7.4 years** - suggests retroactive assignment

### 3. Shell Company Patterns (HIGH SEVERITY)
- **6 firms at same Frisco TX address** (5729 Lebanon Rd)
- Address clustering suggests centralized control
- **5 firms share exact address** - shell company scheme indicator

### 4. License Number Patterns
- All licenses share prefix "226" - coordinated registration
- Sequential license numbers suggest timing patterns
- **License range:** 226011870 to 226038643

### 5. Entity Type Distribution
- **6 Corporations, 5 LLCs** - mix may indicate different purposes
- LLCs may be used for liability protection in shell scheme

### 6. Expiration Date Clustering
- **Coordinated renewal pattern:** 5 firms expire 2026, 5 expire 2027
- Suggests coordinated management

### 7. Geographic Distribution
- **6 states involved:** VA, TX, NC, MO, NE, MD
- **TX cluster:** 6 firms (shell company address)
- Interstate operation suggests complex scheme

### 8. Address Variations
- **Frisco address has 2 variations** (with/without # symbol)
- Same location, different formats may indicate data manipulation

### 9. Missing Data
- **1 firm missing Initial Cert Date** (Edgewood Management)
- Missing dates may hide timeline inconsistencies

### 10. Violation Patterns
- **90+ unregistered STRs** estimated at 800 John Carlyle
- **Multiple violation categories:** License, UPL, Zoning, STR
- Violations across multiple categories indicate systemic issues

## Search Coverage Gaps

### DPOR Searches
- **Status:** All searches are frameworks
- **Coverage:** 0% actual searches performed
- **Impact:** Cannot verify licenses across states

### Bar Association Searches
- **Status:** Frameworks created
- **Coverage:** Needs implementation
- **Impact:** Cannot verify UPL or General Counsel status

## Recommendations

1. **Implement actual DPOR searches** for all 50 states
2. **Complete bar association verification** for Hyland and Curtin
3. **Verify property management licenses** for Moyer and Ramos
4. **Investigate Frisco TX address cluster** - likely shell company operation
5. **Document timeline impossibilities** for administrative filings
6. **Verify STR permit violations** with Alexandria city records

## Next Steps

1. Run actual database searches (not frameworks)
2. Cross-reference anomalies with evidence files
3. Document violations for administrative filings
4. Update violation counts as new data collected
