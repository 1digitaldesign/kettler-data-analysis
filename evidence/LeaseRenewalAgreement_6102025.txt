We  require  do not require you to obtain your own renter’s X insurance in order to protect you and your household and your guests or invitees from any losses to personal property and/or to personal injury proximately caused by any occurrences or incidents such as the ones listed herein, which such list is not exclusive. If no box is checked, renter’s insurance is not required.

In addition, we urge all Tenants, and in particular those residing in property located in a special flood hazard area such as coastal areas, areas near rivers, and areas prone to flooding, to obtain your own flood insurance. Renter’s insurance does not cover damage to your property due to flooding. Consequently, you are advised to contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or visit the websites for FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program or to contact the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation’s Flood Risk Information System to obtain information regarding whether the subject property is located within a special flood hazard area.

X Additionally, you are [check one]  required to purchase personal liability insurance  not required to purchase personal liability insurance. If no box is checked, personal liability insurance is not required. If required, failure to maintain personal liability insurance throughout your tenancy, including any renewal periods and/or lease extensions, is a breach of this Lease Contract and may result in the termination of tenancy and eviction and/or any other remedies as provided by this Lease Contract or state law.

You acknowledge that no portion of the rent paid by you under this agreement will be specifically allocated for the purchase of the owner’s structural fire insurance, though the owner may use a portion of gross rental proceeds obtained from all rental units in the community to purchase such structural fire insurance, and in

such an event, that you are in no way a co-insured under any such policy.

If any damage insurance or any renter’s insurance premiums are to be paid to the landlord prior to the commencement of the tenancy, the total amount of all security deposits, insurance premiums for damage insurance, and insurance premiums for renter’s insurance shall not exceed the amount of two months’ periodic rent. The landlord, however, shall be permitted to add a monthly amount as additional rent to recover additional costs of any renter’s insurance coverage premiums.

9. LOCKS AND LATCHES. Keyed lock(s) will be rekeyed after the prior resident moves out. The rekeying will be done before you move into your apartment.

You may at any time ask us to change or rekey locks or latches during the Lease Term. We must comply with those requests, but you must pay for them, unless otherwise provided by law.

Payment for Rekeying, Repairs, Etc. You must pay for all repairs or replacements arising from misuse or damage to devices by you or your occupants, or guests during your occupancy. You may be required to pay in advance if we notify you within a reasonable time after your request that you are more than 30 days delinquent in reimbursing us for repairing or replacing a device which was misused or damaged by you, your guest or an occupant; or if you have requested that we repair or change or rekey the same device during the 30 days preceding your request and we have complied with your request. Otherwise, you must pay immediately after the work is completed.

Special Provisions and “What If” Clauses

10. SPECIAL PROVISIONS. The following special provisions and any addenda or written rules furnished to you at or before signing will become a part of this Lease Contract and will supersede any conflicting provisions of this printed lease form.

See Additional Special Provisions

See any additional special provisions.

damage to doors, windows, or screens; (2) damage from windows or doors left open; and (3) damage from wastewater stoppages caused by improper objects in lines exclusively serving your apartment. We may require payment at any time, including advance payment of repairs for which you’re liable. Delay in demanding sums you owe is not a waiver.

13. PERSONAL PROPERTY LEFT IN YOUR APARTMENT. For this purpose, “apartment” excludes common areas but includes interior living areas and exterior patios, balconies, attached garages, and storerooms for your exclusive use.

11. EARLY MOVE-OUT. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you’ll be liable to us for a reletting charge of $ (not to exceed 100% of the highest monthly rent during the lease term) if you:

(1) fail to give written move-out notice as required in paragraph 45 (Move-Out Notice); or

(2) move out without paying rent in full for the entire lease term or renewal period; or

(3) move out at our demand because of your default; or

(4) are judicially evicted.

The reletting charge is not a cancellation fee and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, does not release you from your obligations under this Lease Contract. See the next paragraph.

Not a Release. The reletting charge is not a lease cancellation fee or buyout fee. It is an agreed-to liquidated amount covering only part of our damages, that is, our time, effort, and expense in finding and processing a replacement. By law, we are limited to the recovery of actual damages. These damages may be uncertain and difficult to ascertain—particularly those relating to additional paperwork, advertising, showing apartments, utilities for showing, checking prospects, office overhead, marketing costs, and locator-service fees, which would not have been incurred but for your early move-out. You agree that the reletting charge is a reasonable estimate of such damages and that the charge is due whether or not our reletting attempts succeed. If no amount is stipulated, you must pay our actual reletting costs so far as they can be determined. The reletting charge does not release you from continued liability for: future or past-due rent; charges for cleaning, repairing, repainting, or unreturned keys; or other sums due.

12. REIMBURSEMENT. You must promptly reimburse us for loss, damage, government fines, or cost of repairs or service in the apartment community due to a violation of the Lease Contract or rules, improper use, or negligence by you or your guests or occupants. Unless the damage or wastewater stoppage is due to our negligence, we’re not liable for—and you must pay for—repairs, replacement costs, and damage to the following that result from your or your invitees, guests, or occupants’ negligence or intentional acts: (1)

Removal After Termination of Tenancy and Delivery of Possession. We may consider any property left behind in your apartment as abandoned property. Except as provided by applicable law, we’re not liable for casualty loss, damage, or theft. We will give you 10 days’ written notice to your last known address, address correction requested, if we are going to dispose of the property in any way. If we have sold any abandoned property, we may apply the funds received to any amounts you may owe us, including reasonable costs incurred by us in selling or storing the abandoned property. Any remaining funds will be treated as a security deposit. All property in the apartment is presumed to be yours unless proven otherwise. This paragraph is not applicable if we have been granted a writ of possession for the apartment.

Removal after Eviction. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may ask the sheriff to place all property remaining in the apartment or in common areas (including any vehicles you or any occupant or guest owns or uses) in the public way if you are judicially evicted (see definitions in paragraph 50 - Deposit Return, Surrender, and Abandonment). You will have 24 hours to remove your property from the public way or it will be disposed of by the landlord.

Removal after Surrender or Abandonment. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may remove or store all property remaining in the apartment or in common areas (including any vehicles you or any occupant or guest owns or uses) if you surrender or abandon the apartment (see definitions in paragraph 50 - Deposit Return, Surrender, and Abandonment).

Disposition or Sale. Disposition or sale of your abandoned property, if any, must comply with Virginia Code Section 55.1-1254.

14. FAILING TO PAY FIRST MONTH’S RENT. If you don’t pay the first month’s rent when or before the Lease Contract begins such noncompliance will constitute a default by you under this Lease.

15. RENT INCREASES AND LEASE CONTRACT CHANGES.

No rent increases or Lease Contract changes are allowed before the initial Lease Contract term ends, except for changes allowed by any special provisions in paragraph 10 (Special Provisions), by a written addendum or amendment signed by you and us, or by reasonable changes of apartment rules allowed under paragraph 19 (Community Policies or Rules). If, at least 5 days before the advance notice deadline

Page 2 of 8

referred to in paragraph 3 (Lease Term) or such longer period as is required by applicable law, we give you written notice of rent increases or lease changes effective when the lease term or renewal period ends, this Lease Contract will automatically continue monthto-month with the increased rent or lease changes. The new modified Lease Contract will begin on the date stated in the notice (without necessity of your signature) unless you give us written move-out notice under paragraph 45 (Move-Out Notice).

16. DELAY OF OCCUPANCY. If occupancy is or will be delayed for construction, repairs, cleaning, or a previous resident’s holding over, we’re not responsible for the delay. The Lease Contract will remain in force subject to: (1) abatement of rent on a daily basis during delay; and (2) your right to terminate as set forth below. Termination notice must be in writing. After termination, you are entitled only to refund of deposit(s) and any rent paid. Rent abatement or lease termination does not apply if delay is for cleaning or repairs that don’t prevent you from occupying the apartment.

If there is a delay and we haven’t given notice of delay as set forth immediately below, you may terminate up to the date when the apartment is ready for occupancy, but not later.

(1) If we give written notice to any of you when or after the initial term as set forth in paragraph 3 (Lease Term)—and the notice states that occupancy has been delayed because of construction or a previous resident’s holding over, and that the apartment will be ready on a specific date—you may terminate the Lease Contract within 5 days of your receiving the notice, but not later.

(2) If we give written notice to any of you before the initial term as set forth in paragraph 3 (Lease Term) and the notice states that construction delay is expected and that the apartment will

be ready for you to occupy on a specific date, you may terminate the Lease Contract within 5 days after any of you receives written notice, but not later. The readiness date is considered the new initial term as set forth in paragraph 3 (Lease Term) for all purposes. This new date may not be moved to an earlier date unless we and you agree.

17. AD VALOREM TAXES/FEES AND CHARGES - ADDITIONAL RENT. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, if, during the term of this Agreement, any locality, city, state, or Federal Government imposes upon us, any fee, charge, or tax, which is related to or charged by the number of occupants, or by the apartment unit itself, such that we are charged a fee, charge, or tax, based upon your use or occupancy of the apartment, we may add this charge as Additional Rent, during the term of the Lease Contract, with thirty (30) days advance written notice to you. After this written notice (the amount or approximate amount of the charge, will be included), you agree to pay, as Additional Rent, the amount of the charge, tax or fee imposed upon us, as a result of your occupancy. As examples, these charges can include, but are not limited to: any charges we receive for any zoning violation, sound, noise or litter charge; any charge under any nuisance or chronic nuisance type statute, 911 or other life safety, per person, or per unit charge or tax and any utility bill unpaid by you, which is then assessed to us for payment.

18. DISCLOSURE RIGHTS. If someone requests information on you or your rental history, we are only permitted to release your rent payment record and amount of payment without your prior consent. A contract purchaser of the rental property may inspect all tenants’ information without obtaining your consent provided that said contract purchaser agrees in writing to maintain the confidentiality of said information.

While You’re Living in the Apartment

19. COMMUNITY POLICIES OR RULES. You and all guests and occupants must comply with any written apartment rules and community policies, including instructions for care of our property. Our rules are considered part of this Lease Contract. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may make reasonable changes to written rules, if they are distributed and applicable to all units in the apartment community and do not constitute a substantial modification of the bargain nor change dollar amounts on page 1 of this Lease Contract and you have been given reasonable notice of the same.

20. LIMITATIONS ON CONDUCT. The apartment and other areas reserved for your private use must be kept clean and free of trash, garbage, and other debris. Trash must be disposed of at least weekly in appropriate receptacles in accordance with local ordinances. Passageways may be used only for entry or exit. You agree to keep all passageways and common areas free of obstructions such as trash, storage items, and all forms of personal property. No person shall ride or allow bikes, skateboards, or other similar objects in the passageways. Any swimming pools, saunas, spas, tanning beds, exercise rooms, storerooms, laundry rooms, and similar areas must be used with care in accordance with apartment rules and posted signs. Glass containers are prohibited in all common areas. You, your occupants, or guests may not anywhere in the apartment community: use candles or use kerosene lamps or kerosene heaters without our prior written approval; cook on balconies or outside; or solicit business or contributions. Conducting any kind of business (including child care services) in your apartment or in the apartment community is prohibited—except that any lawful business conducted “at home” by computer, mail, or telephone is permissible if customers, clients, patients, or other business associates do not come to your apartment for business purposes. We may regulate: (1) the use of patios, balconies, and porches; (2) the conduct of furniture movers and delivery persons; and (3) recreational activities in common areas. You’ll be liable to us for damage caused by you or any guests or occupants.

We may exclude from the apartment community guests or others who, in our judgment, have been violating the law, violating this Lease Contract or any apartment rules, or disturbing other residents, neighbors, visitors, or owner representatives. We will serve written notice personally on any such guest and also serve you a copy of the notice if your guest is the one in violation. In addition to the remedies we may have against you, we can apply to a magistrate for a warrant for trespass, provided we have served the required notice. We may also exclude from any outside area or common area a person who refuses to show photo identification or refuses to identify himself or herself as a resident, occupant, or guest of a specific resident in the community.

You agree to notify us if you or any occupants are convicted of any felony, or misdemeanor involving a controlled substance, violence to another person or destruction of property. You also agree to notify us if you or any occupant registers as a sex offender in any state. Informing us of criminal convictions or sex offender registry does not waive our right to evict you.

23. RELEASE OF RESIDENT. Unless you’re entitled to terminate your tenancy under paragraphs 10 (Special Provisions), 16 (Delay of Occupancy), 32 (Responsibilities of Owner), or 45 (Move-Out Notice), or any other applicable law, you won’t be released from this Lease Contract for any reason—including but not limited to voluntary or involuntary school withdrawal or transfer, voluntary or involuntary job transfer, marriage, separation, divorce, reconciliation, loss of co-residents, loss of employment, bad health, or death.

24. MILITARY PERSONNEL CLAUSE. All parties to this Lease Contract agree to comply with any federal law, including, but not limited to the Service Member’s Civil Relief Act, or any applicable state law(s), if you are seeking to terminate this Lease Contract and/or subsequent renewals and/or Lease Contract extensions under the rights granted by such laws.

25. RESIDENT SAFETY AND PROPERTY LOSS. You and all occupants and guests must exercise due care for your own and others’ safety and security, especially in the use of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, keyed deadbolt locks, keyless bolting devices, window latches, and access control devices.

Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Detectors. We’ll furnish smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors only if required by statute, and we’ll test them and provide working batteries when you first take possession. After that, we will provide a certificate to you stating that all smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are present, have been inspected, and are in good working order no more than once every twelve (12) months. You are required to maintain said smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and are to pay for and are required to replace batteries as needed, unless the law provides otherwise. We may replace dead or missing batteries at your expense, without prior notice to you. You must immediately report smoke detector and carbon monoxide detector malfunctions to us. Neither you nor any others may disable the smoke detectors or the carbon monoxide detectors. If you disable or damage the smoke detector or carbon monoxide detector or fail to replace a dead battery or report malfunctions to us, you will be in breach of this Lease Contract and will be liable to us for any actual damages and for any loss, damage, or fines proximately cause by or related to any fire, smoke or water.

Casualty Loss. We’re not liable to any resident, guest, or occupant for personal injury or damage or loss of personal property from any cause, including but not limited to: fire, smoke, rain, flood, water and pipe leaks, hail, ice, snow, lightning, wind, explosions, earthquake, interruption of utilities, theft, or vandalism unless otherwise required by law. During freezing weather, you must ensure that the temperature in the apartment is sufficient to make sure that the pipes do not freeze (the appropriate temperature will depend upon weather conditions and the size and layout of your unit). If the pipes freeze or any other damage is caused by your failure to properly maintain the heat in your apartment, you’ll be liable for damage to our and other’s property. If you ask our representatives to perform services not contemplated in this Lease Contract, you will indemnify us and hold us harmless from all liability for those services, provided that we owe no legal duty to you under the applicable law.

Crime or Emergency. Dial 911 or immediately call local medical emergency, fire, or police personnel in case of accident, fire, smoke, or suspected criminal activity or other emergency involving imminent harm. You should then contact our representative. Unless otherwise provided by law, we’re not liable to you or any guests or occupants for injury, damage, or loss to person or property caused by criminal conduct of other persons, including theft, burglary, assault, vandalism, or other crimes. We’re not obliged to furnish security personnel, security lighting, security gates or fences, or other forms of security. If we provide any access control devices or security measures upon the property, they are not a guarantee to prevent crime or to reduce the risk of crime on the property. You agree that no access control or security measures can eliminate all crime and that you will not rely upon any provided access control or security measures as a warranty or guarantee of any kind. We’re not responsible for obtaining criminal-history checks on any residents, occupants, guests, or contractors in the apartment community. If you or any occupant or guest is affected by a crime, you must make a written report to our representative and to the appropriate local law-enforcement agency. You must also furnish us with the law-enforcement agency’s incident report number upon request.

26. CONDITION OF THE PREMISES AND ALTERATIONS.

Except for our duty to maintain in good and safe condition all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, air conditioning and other facilities, and, except for conditions materially affecting the health or safety of ordinary persons, you accept the apartment, fixtures, and furniture as is. You’ll be given an Inventory and Condition form on or before move-in. Within 5 days after move-in, you must note on the form all defects or damage and return it to

our representative. Otherwise, everything will be considered to be in a clean, safe, and good working condition.

You must use customary diligence in maintaining the apartment and not damaging or littering the common areas. You must follow proper trash removal procedures. Unless authorized by statute or by us in writing, you must not perform any repairs, painting, wallpapering, carpeting, electrical changes, or otherwise alter our property. No holes or stickers are allowed inside or outside the apartment. But we’ll permit a reasonable number of small nail holes for hanging pictures on sheetrock walls and in grooves of woodpaneled walls, unless our rules state otherwise. No water furniture, washing machines, additional phone or TV-cable outlets, alarm systems, or lock changes, additions, or rekeying is permitted unless statutorily allowed or we’ve consented in writing. You may install a satellite dish or antenna provided you sign our satellite dish or antenna lease addendum which complies with reasonable restrictions allowed by federal law. You agree not to alter, damage, or remove our property, including alarm systems, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, furniture, telephone and cable TV wiring, screens, locks, and access control devices. When you move in, we’ll supply light bulbs for fixtures we furnish, including exterior fixtures operated from inside the apartment; after that, you’ll replace them at your expense with bulbs of the same type and wattage. Your improvements to the apartment (whether or not we consent) become ours unless we agree otherwise in writing.

In addition to the requirements outlined in this Lease Contract, you are responsible for complying with the obligations imposed on you by applicable provisions of the building and housing codes materially affecting health and safety.

27. REQUESTS, REPAIRS, AND MALFUNCTIONS. IF YOU OR ANY OCCUPANT NEEDS TO SEND A NOTICE OR REQUEST—FOR EXAMPLE, FOR REPAIRS, INSTALLATIONS, SERVICES, OR SECURITY-RELATED MATTERS—IT MUST BE SUBMITTED THROUGH EITHER THE ONLINE RESIDENT/MAINTENANCE PORTAL, OR SIGNED AND IN WRITING AND DELIVERED TO OUR DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE (except in case of fire, smoke, gas, explosion, overflowing sewage, uncontrollable running water, electrical shorts, or crime in progress). Our written notes on your oral request do not constitute a written request from you.

Our complying with or responding to any oral request regarding security or non-security matters doesn’t waive the strict requirement for written notices under this Lease Contract. You must promptly notify us in writing of: water leaks; electrical problems; malfunctioning lights; broken or missing locks or latches; and other conditions that pose a hazard to property, health, or safety. We may change or install utility lines or equipment serving the apartment if the work is done reasonably without substantially increasing your utility costs. We may turn off equipment and interrupt utilities as needed to avoid property damage or to perform work. If utilities malfunction or are damaged by fire, water, or similar cause, you must notify our representative immediately. Air conditioning and lack of heat are considered emergencies. Consequently, in the event of any air conditioning or heating or other such equipment malfunctions, you are to notify our representatives as soon as possible. We’ll act with customary diligence to make repairs and reconnections.

If the premises are damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty to such an extent that your enjoyment of the premises is substantially impaired, you may immediately vacate and serve on us a written notice within 14 days thereafter, indicating your intent to terminate your tenancy. Your tenancy would be terminated as of the day you vacated the premises. If we and you cannot agree as to the issue of habitability, the decision of the local building inspector will govern.

28. ANIMALS. Unless otherwise provided under federal, state, or local law, no animals (including mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, rodents, and insects) are allowed, even temporarily, anywhere in the apartment or apartment Community unless we’ve so authorized in writing. You must remove an illegal or unauthorized animal within 24 hours of notice from us, or you will be considered in default of this Lease Contract, after which you will receive a 21/30 Material Noncompliance Notice. If we allow an animal as a pet, you must execute a separate animal addendum which may require additional deposits, rents, fees or other charges. An animal deposit is considered a general security deposit. We will authorize an assistance animal for a disabled person. When allowed by applicable laws, before we authorize an assistance animal, if the disability and/or the disabilityrelated need for the assistance animal are not readily apparent, we may require a written statement from a qualified professional verifying the disability and/or disability-related need for the assistance animal. If we authorize an assistance animal, we may require you to execute a separate animal and/or assistance animal addendum. Animal deposits, additional rents, fees or other charges

Page 4 of 8

will not be required for an assistance animal needed due to disability, including an emotional support or service animal, as authorized under federal, state, or local law. You must not feed stray or wild animals.

If you or any guest or occupant violates animal restrictions (with or without your knowledge), we may serve on you a written notice describing your violation and stating that your tenancy will terminate on a date not less than 30 days after you have received the notice if you do not cure the violation within 21 days. If you properly remedy the violation within 21 days, then your tenancy will not terminate. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if an animal has been in the apartment at any time during your term of occupancy (with or without our consent), we’ll charge you for defleaing, deodorizing, and shampooing. Animal-violation charges are liquidated damages for our time, costs, and overhead (except for attorney’s fees and litigation costs) in enforcing animal restrictions and rules.

29. WHEN WE MAY ENTER. You shall not unreasonably withhold consent for us to enter the apartment in order to inspect the apartment, make necessary or agreed upon repairs, decorations, alterations or improvements, supply necessary or agreed upon services or exhibit the apartment to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees, tenants, workmen or contractors. We may enter the apartment without your consent in the event of an emergency. Unless impractical, we will give you 72 hours written notice of routine maintenance (not requested by you) to be performed in the apartment.

We will give you written notice no less than 48 hours before the application of pesticide in the apartment unless you agree to a shorter notice period. If you have requested us to apply pesticide

in the apartment, we are not required to give you written notice. If you are concerned with specific pesticides, you must notify us in writing no less than 24 hours before the scheduled pesticide application.

If a tenant, without reasonable justification, declines to permit the landlord or managing agent to exhibit the dwelling unit for sale or lease, the landlord may recover damages, costs, and reasonable attorney fees against such tenant. As used herein, “reasonable justification” is defined in accordance with Virginia Code Section 55.1-1229 (A)(3).

Further, during a state of emergency declared by the Governor pursuant to з 44-146.17 in response to a communicable disease of public health threat as defined in з 44-146.16, access will be provided in accordance with Virginia Code Section 55.1-1229 (A)(4).

You must notify us of any anticipated extended absence from your apartment of greater than 7 days. During this absence, we may enter the apartment at times reasonably necessary to protect the apartment. If you fail to give us such notice, we may recover actual damages from you.

30. JOINT AND SEVERAL RESPONSIBILITY. Each resident is jointly and severally liable for all lease obligations. If you or any guest or occupant violates the Lease Contract or rules, all residents are considered to have violated the Lease Contract. Notices and requests from any resident or occupant (including notices of lease termination, repair requests, and entry permissions) constitute notice from all residents. Security-deposit refunds and deduction itemizations of multiple residents will comply with paragraph 50 - Deposit Return, Surrender, and Abandonment.

Replacements

31. REPLACEMENTS AND SUBLETTING. Replacing a resident, subletting, assignment, or granting a right or license to occupy is allowed only when we expressly consent in writing. If departing or remaining residents find a replacement resident acceptable to us before moving out and we expressly, in writing, consent to the replacement, subletting, assignment, or granting a right or any license to occupy, then:

(1) a reletting charge will not be due;

(2) a reasonable administrative (paperwork) and/or transfer fee will be due, and a rekeying fee will be due if rekeying is requested or required; and

(3) in the case of subletting and in granting a right or license to occupy, the departing and remaining residents will remain liable for all lease obligations for the rest of the original lease term.

Procedures for Replacement. If we approve a replacement resident, then, at our option: (1) the replacement resident must sign this Lease Contract with or without an increase in the total security deposit; or (2) the remaining and replacement residents must sign an entirely new Lease Contract. Unless we agree otherwise in writing, your security deposit will automatically transfer to the replacement resident as of the date we approve. The departing resident will no longer have a right to occupancy, but may remain liable for the remainder of the original lease term unless otherwise agreed to in writing.

Responsibilities of Owner and Resident

32. RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNER. We’ll act with customary diligence to:

(1) keep common areas reasonably clean and in a structurally safe condition, subject to paragraph 26 (Condition of the Premises and Alterations);

(2) maintain fixtures, furniture, hot water, heating and A/C equipment;

(3) comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding safety, sanitation, and fair housing; and

(4) make all reasonable repairs, subject to your obligation to pay for damages for which you are liable.

If we violate the above, the following remedies apply:

(a) you must make a written request for repair or remedy of the condition, and all rent must be current at the time;

(b) after receiving the request, we have a reasonable time to repair, considering the nature of the problem and the reasonable availability of materials, labor, and utilities;

If we fail to remedy the condition within a reasonable time, you may exercise any other remedies provided under Virginia law, including but not limited to Virginia Code Section 55.1-1244.1, as amended.

33. DEFAULT BY RESIDENT.

Default by Resident. You’ll be in default if you or any guest or occupant violates any terms of this Lease Contract including but not limited to the following violations: (1) you don’t pay rent or other amounts that you owe when due; (2) you or any guest or occupant violates the apartment rules, or fire, safety, health, or criminal laws, regardless of whether or where arrest or conviction occurs; (3) you abandon the apartment; (4) you give incorrect or false answers in a rental application; (5) you or any occupant is arrested, convicted, or given deferred adjudication for a felony offense involving actual

or potential physical harm to a person, or involving possession, manufacture, or delivery of a controlled substance, marijuana, or drug paraphernalia under state statute; (6) any illegal drugs or paraphernalia are found in your apartment; or (7) you or any guest or occupant engages in any of the prohibited conduct described in paragraph 21 (Prohibited Conduct).

Under Virginia law and this Lease Agreement, we may terminate this tenancy in accordance with the following provisions:

A. Material Noncompliance by Your Failing to Pay Rent When Due. Your rent is due and payable on the 1st day of each calendar month. If you fail to pay such rent after we have served a material noncompliance notice for failure to pay rent, or pay or quit notice, as applicable, we may terminate your tenancy in accordance with applicable Virginia law.

B. Material Noncompliance by You Which Can Be Remedied Within 21 Days. If you commit a material noncompliance under this Lease Contract which can be remedied within 21 days, we may serve on you a material noncompliance notice stating that if you do not remedy the specified noncompliances(s) within 21 days from the date of such notice, we have the right to terminate your tenancy on a date that is not less than 30 days after your receipt of such material noncompliance notice.

C. Repeat Violations. If you have been served with a prior written notice which required you to remedy a breach, and you remedied such breach, where you intentionally commit a subsequent breach of a like nature as the prior breach, we may serve on you a 30 day termination notice. Such notice must make reference to the prior breach of a like nature and state that your tenancy will terminate on a date not less than 30 days after your receipt of such notice for the reasons stated therein without allowing you an opportunity to remedy such subsequent breach.

© 2024, National Apartment Association, Inc. - 6/2024, Virginia

Page 5 of 8

D. Nonremediable Violations. If you commit a material noncompliance, we may serve on you a termination notice stating that your tenancy will terminate on a date that is not less than 30 days after your receipt of such notice for the reasons stated in such notice. If a breach of your obligations under the Virginia law, or the Lease Contract, involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act, which is not remediable and which poses a threat to health or safety, we may terminate your tenancy immediately by written notice to you.

E. Remediable Violations. If you commit a material noncompliance, we may serve on you a termination notice stating that your tenancy will terminate on a date that is not less than 30 days after your receipt of such notice for the reasons stated in such notice. If the noncompliance can be remedied by repair or payment of damages or otherwise and you adequately remedy the noncompliance within 21 days of the receipt of notice, your tenancy will not terminate. If you fail to maintain the apartment as required by applicable law or by this Lease Contract but the violation is remediable by repair, replacement or cleaning, the owner or the owner’s representative shall send a written notice to the resident specifying the breach and stating that the owner or the owner’s representative will enter the dwelling unit and perform the work in a workmanlike manner and submit an itemized bill for the actual and reasonable cost for such work to the tenant, which shall be due as rent on the next rent due date or, if the rental agreement has terminated, for immediate payment.

In case of emergency the owner or the owner’s representative may, as promptly as conditions require, enter the dwelling unit, perform the work in a workmanlike manner, and submit an itemized bill for the actual and reasonable cost for such work to the resident, which shall be due as rent on the next rent due date or, if the rental agreement has terminated, for immediate payment.

F. Acceptance of Rent With Reservation. Unless we accept the rent with reservation in accordance with Virginia Code Section 55.1-1250, acceptance of periodic rent payments with knowledge of a material noncompliance by you constitutes a waiver of our right to terminate your tenancy. If we have given you written notice that the periodic rental payments have been accepted with reservation, any partial payment of rent made before or after a judgment of possession is ordered will not prevent the owner from taking action to evict you. However, full payment

of all amounts you owe the owner, including all rent as contracted for in the rental agreement that is owed to the owner as of the date payment is made, as well as any damages, money judgment, award of attorney fees, and court costs made at least 48 hours before the scheduled eviction will cause the eviction to be canceled, unless there are bases for the entry of an order of possession other than nonpayment of rent stated in the unlawful detainer action filed by the owner. Further, the acceptance of the said amount with reservation in no way creates a new landlord/tenant relationship with you.

G. Remedies Available to us Upon Breach or Noncompliance of the Lease Contract. In the event of a breach of the Lease Contract or noncompliance by the Resident as provided herein and under applicable Virginia law, the Owner shall be entitled to recover from the Resident the following, regardless of whether a lawsuit is filed or an order is obtained from a court: (i) rent due and owing as contracted for in the Lease Contract, (ii) other charges and fees as contracted for in the Lease Contract, (iii) late charges contracted for in the Lease Contract, (iv) reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by Owner, (v) costs of the proceeding as contracted for in the Lease Contract or as provided by law only if court action has been filed, and (vi) damages to the dwelling unit or premises as contracted for in the Lease Contract. The Owner may also file an unlawful detainer action in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a judgment for possession of the leased premises, as well as a judgment for the aforesaid available remedies. Upon termination of the Lease Contract, we may treat the security deposit as provided in other provisions of this Lease Contract, appropriate addenda hereto, and applicable Virginia law.

Lease Renewal When A Breach or Default Has Occurred. In the event that you enter into a subsequent Lease prior to the expiration of this Lease and you breach or otherwise commit a default under this Lease, we may, at our sole and absolute discretion, terminate the subsequent Lease, even if the subsequent Lease term has yet to commence. We may terminate said subsequent Lease by sending you written notice of our desire to terminate said subsequent Lease.

Remedies Cumulative. Any remedies set forth herein shall be cumulative, in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedies available to Landlord under any applicable law.

36. NO WAIVER. No action or omission of our representative will be considered a waiver of any subsequent violation, default, or time or place of performance.

Any person giving a notice under this Lease Contract should retain a copy of the memo, letter or fax that was given. Fax signatures are binding. All notices must be signed. To the extent allowed by law, notice to or from us may be made via email or other electronic form, including all notices required by Section 55.1-1245 of the Code of Virginia or other law.

38. MISCELLANEOUS.

B. Unless prohibited by law or the respective insurance policies, insurance subrogation is waived by all parties.

C. All remedies are cumulative.

D. No employee, agent, or management company is personally liable for any of our contractual, statutory, or other obligations merely by virtue of acting on our behalf.

G. To the extent permitted by applicable law, all provisions regarding our non-liability and nonduty apply to our employees, agents, and management companies.

H. This Lease Contract is subordinate or superior to existing and future recorded mortgages, at lender’s option.

I. All lease obligations must be performed in the county where the apartment is located.

J. All discretionary rights reserved for us within this Lease Contract or any accompanying addenda are at our sole and absolute discretion.

39. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. To minimize legal expenses and, to the extent allowed by law, you and we agree that a trial of any lawsuit based on statute common law, and/or related to this Lease Contract shall be tried to a judge and not a jury; the parties hereto having expressly agreed to waive any trial by jury.

40. CONTACTING YOU. By signing this lease, you are agreeing that we, our representative(s) or agent(s) may contact you. You agree that we may contact you using any contact information relating to your lease including any number (i) you have provided to us (ii) from which you called us, or (iii) which we obtained and through which we reasonably believe we can reach you. You agree we may use any means to contact you. This may include calls made to your cellular telephone using an automatic telephone dialing system, artificial or prerecorded voice messages, text messages, mail, e-mail, and calls to your phone or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service, or any other data or voice transmission technology. You agree to promptly notify us if you change any contact information you provide to us. You are responsible for any service provider charges as a result of us contacting you.

41. OBLIGATION TO VACATE. If we provide you with a notice to vacate, or if you provide us with a written notice to vacate or intent to move-out in accordance with paragraph 3 (Lease Term), and we accept such written notice, then you are required to vacate the Apartment and remove all of your personal property therefrom at the expiration of the Lease term, or by the date set forth in the notice to vacate, whichever date is earlier, without further notice or demand from us.

Page 6 of 8

42. FORCE MAJEURE. If we are prevented from completing performances of any obligations hereunder by an act of God, strikes, epidemics, war, acts of terrorism, riots, flood, fire, hurricane, tornado, sabotage, or other occurrence which is beyond the control of the parties, then we shall be excused from any further performance of obligations and undertakings hereunder, to the full extent allowed under applicable law.

Furthermore, if such an event damages the property to materially affect its habitability by some or all residents, we reserve the right to vacate any and all leases and you agree to excuse us from any further performance of obligations and undertakings hereunder, to the full extent allowed under applicable law.

43. PAYMENTS. Payment of all sums is an independent covenant. At our option and without notice, we may apply money received (other than sale proceeds under paragraph 13 (Personal Property Left in Your Apartment) or utility payments subject to governmental

regulations) first to any of your unpaid obligations, then to current rent—regardless of notations on checks or money orders and regardless of when the obligations arose. All sums other than rent are due upon our demand. If we have accepted without reservation rent payments that were materially noncompliant and have given you written notice of such acceptance, then we have waived our right to terminate your tenancy. If we have given you written notice that your rent payments have been accepted with reservation, then we may accept all rent payments, and we may still be entitled to an order of possession terminating the tenancy in accordance with Virginia Code Section 55.1-1250, as amended.

44. ASSOCIATION MEMBERSHIP. We represent that either: (1) we or; (2) the management company that represents us, is at the time of signing this Lease Contract or a renewal of this Lease Contract, a member of both the National Apartment Association and any affiliated state and local apartment (multi-housing) associations for the area where the apartment is located.

When Moving Out

45. MOVE-OUT NOTICE. Before moving out, either at the end of the lease term, any extension of the lease term, or prior to the end of the lease term, you must give our representative advance written notice of your intention to vacate as required by paragraph 3 (Lease Term). If you move out prior to the end of the lease term, your notice does not act as a release of liability for the full term of the Lease Contract. If you vacate early (paragraph 23 - Release of Resident) you will still be liable for the entire Lease Contract term or until a new lease contract is executed, whichever occurs first, except if you are able to terminate your tenancy under the statutory rights explained under paragraphs 11, or 23 (Early Move-Out or Release of Resident), or any other applicable laws. All notices to vacate must be in writing and must provide the date by which you intend to vacate. If the notice does not comply with the time requirements of paragraph 3 (Lease Term), even if you move by the last date in the lease term, you will be responsible for an additional month’s rent. If you fail to vacate by the date set forth in your notice of nonrenewal or in your notice to vacate, or in our notice of nonrenewal or in our notice to vacate delivered to you, you will automatically and will immediately become a holdover tenant pursuant to applicable Virginia law, and we will have all rights and remedies available to us under this Lease Contract and Virginia law, including but not limited to charging you a liquidated damage penalty not to exceed an amount equal to 150 percent (150%) of the per diem of the monthly rent, for each day you remain in the dwelling unit after the termination date specified in your notice of nonrenewal or in your notice to vacate, or in our notice of nonrenewal or in our notice to vacate delivered to you.

46. MOVE-OUT PROCEDURES. The move-out date can’t be changed unless we and you both agree in writing. You won’t move out before the lease term or renewal period ends unless all rent for the entire lease term or renewal period is paid in full. Early move-out may result in reletting charges under paragraph 11 (Early Move-Out). You’re prohibited by law from applying any security deposit to rent. You are not permitted to stay beyond the date you are supposed to move out.

47. CLEANING. You must thoroughly clean the apartment, including doors, windows, furniture, bathrooms, kitchen appliances, patios, balconies, garages, carports, and storage rooms. You must follow move-out cleaning instructions if they have been provided. If you don’t clean adequately, you’ll be liable for reasonable cleaning charges.

48. MOVE-OUT INSPECTION. You should meet with our representative for a move-out inspection. Our representative has no authority to bind or limit us regarding deductions for repairs, damages, or charges. Any statements or estimates by us or our representative are subject to our correction, modification, or disapproval before final refunding or accounting. If you wish to be present when we make the inspection, you must so advise us in writing, and then we will provide you with written notice of the time and date of our inspection of the apartment. You will have the right to be present at our inspection of the apartment for the purpose of determining the amount of security deposit to be returned. We will provide you with notice of the time and date of the inspection at least ten (10) days before the date of the inspection. The inspection will be made within three (3) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) after delivery of possession. If you attend the inspection, we will upon completion of the inspection give you an itemized list of damages to the apartment known to exist at the time of the inspection. We suggest that you do accompany us during the inspection to help resolve any problems that may arise. Failure to do so will constitute a concurrence by you in our assessment of charges for damages or

BED BUGS - A Guide for Rental Housing Residents

Bed bugs, with a typical lifespan of 6 to 12 months, are wingless, flat, broadly oval-shaped insects. Capable of reaching the size of an apple seed at full growth, bed bugs are distinguishable by their reddish-brown color, although after feeding on the blood of humans and warm-blooded animals—their sole food sourcethe bugs assume a distinctly blood-red hue until digestion is complete.

Bed bugs don’t discriminate Bed bugs increased presence across the United States in recent decades can be attributed largely to a surge in international travel and trade. It’s no surprise then that bed bugs have been found time and time again to have taken up residence in some of the fanciest hotels and apartment buildings in some of the nation’s most expensive neighborhoods.

Nonetheless, false claims that associate bed bugs presence with poor hygiene and uncleanliness have caused rental housing residents, out of shame, to avoid notifying owners of their presence. This serves only to enable the spread of bed bugs.

While bed bugs are, by their very nature, more attracted to clutter, they’re certainly not discouraged by cleanliness.

Bottom line: bed bugs know no social and economic bounds; claims to the contrary are false.

Bed bugs don’t transmit disease There exists no scientific evidence that bed bugs transmit disease. In fact, federal agencies tasked with addressing pest of public health concern, namely the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have refused to elevate bed bugs to the threat level posed by disease transmitting pests. Again, claims associating bed bugs with disease are false.

Identifying bed bugs Bed bugs can often be found in, around and between:

• Bedding

• Bed frames

• Mattress seams

• Upholstered furniture, especially under cushions and along seams

• Around, behind and under wood furniture, especially along areas where drawers slide

• Curtains and draperies

• Along window and door frames

• Ceiling and wall junctions

• Crown moldings

• Behind and around wall hangings and loose wallpaper

• Between carpeting and walls (carpet can be pulled away from the wall and tack strip)

• Cracks and crevices in walls and floors

• Inside electronic devices, such as smoke and carbon monoxide detectors

• Because bed bugs leave some persons with itchy welts strikingly similar to those caused by fleas and mosquitoes, the origination of such markings often go misdiagnosed. However, welts caused by bed bugs often times appear in succession and on exposed areas of skin, such as the face, neck and arms. In some cases, an individual may not experience any visible reaction resulting from direct contact with bed bugs.

• While bed bugs typically prefer to act at night, they often do not succeed in returning to their hiding spots without leaving traces of their presence through fecal markings of a red to dark brown color, visible on or near beds. Blood stains tend also to appear when the bugs have been squashed, usually by an unsuspecting host in their sleep. And, because they shed, it’s not uncommon for skin casts to be left behind in areas typically frequented by bed bugs.

Preventing bed bug encounters when traveling Because humans serve as bed bugs’ main mode of transportation, it is extremely important to be mindful of bed bugs when away from home. Experts agree that the spread of bed bugs across all regions of the United States is largely attributed to an increase in international travel and trade. Travelers are therefore encouraged to take a few minutes upon arriving to their temporary destination to thoroughly inspect their accommodations, so as to ensure that any uninvited guests are detected before the decision is made to unpack.

Because bed bugs can easily travel from one room to another, it is also recommended that travelers thoroughly inspect their luggage and belongings for bed bugs before departing for home.

Bed bug do’s and don’ts

• Do not bring used furniture from unknown sources into your dwelling. Countless bed bug infestations have stemmed directly from the introduction into a resident’s unit of secondhand and abandoned furniture. Unless the determination can be made with absolute certainty that a piece of second-hand furniture is bed bug-free, residents should assume that the reason a seemingly nice looking leather couch, for example, is sitting curbside, waiting to be hauled off to the landfill, may very well be due to the fact that it’s teeming with bed bugs.

• Do address bed bug sightings immediately. Rental housing residents who suspect the presence of bed bugs in their unit must immediately notify the owner.

• Do not attempt to treat bed bug infestations. Under no circumstance should you attempt to eradicate bed bugs. Health hazards associated with the misapplication of traditional and non-traditional, chemical-based insecticides and pesticides poses too great a risk to you and your neighbors.

• Do comply with eradication protocol. If the determination is made that your unit is indeed playing host to bed bugs, you must comply with the bed bug eradication protocol set forth by both your owner and their designated pest management company.

This Addendum is attached to and becomes a part of the Residential Lease Agreement.

For the duration of the Lease Agreement, Lessee is required to maintain and provide evidence of either tenant liability insurance or renters insurance (“Required insurance”). Minimum coverage under Lessee’s tenant liability insurance or renters insurance policy must be no less than:

($100,000) Limit of Liability for Lessee’s legal liability for damage to the landlord’s property

Lessee is required to furnish Lessor with evidence of Required Insurance prior to occupancy of leased premises and at the time of each lease renewal period. If at any time Lessee does not have such insurance, Lessor has the right to ‘force place’ replacement coverage and charge Lessee a fee to cover the expense for such insurance.

Lessee may obtain Required Insurance from an insurance agent or insurance company of Lessee’s choice. If Lessee furnishes evidence of such insurance and maintains the insurance for the duration of the Lease Agreement, then nothing more is required. If Lessee does not maintain Required Insurance, the insurance requirement of this Lease Agreement may be satisfied by Lessor, who may schedule the Lessee’s unit for coverage under the MASTER POLICY. The coverage provided under the MASTER POLICY will include Required Insurance coverage listed above. An amount equal to the total cost to the Lessor of adding Lessee’s unit to the MASTER POLICY shall be charged back to Lessee by the Lessor, or the Lessor’s authorized representative. Some important points of this coverage, which Lessee should understand are:

1. Lessor is the Named Insured under the MASTER POLICY. Lessee is an Additional Insured under the tenant liability component of the MASTER POLICY for liability arising from onpremises Bodily Injury and Property Damage up to the Limits of Liability appearing above.

2. MASTER POLICY coverage is not personal liability insurance or renters insurance. Lessee makes no warranty or representation that MASTER POLICY covers the Lessor’s personal property (contents) or additional living expenses. Although coverage may be similar to a personal liability insurance policy or the liability portion of a Renters Insurance Policy, the MASTER POLICY may not protect Lessee as if Lessee had purchased personal liability or renters insurance from an insurance agent or insurance company of Lessee’s choice. Certain restrictions apply.

3. Coverage only applies to liability arising on the residence premises. Lessee is not insured away from the residence premises.

4. Coverage under the MASTER POLICY may be more expensive than the cost of Required Insurance available to the Lessee. At any time, Lessee may contact an agent of their choice for personal liability or renters insurance options to satisfy the Required Insurance under the Lease Agreement.

5. Licensed insurance agents may receive a commission on the MASTER POLICY.

6. The fee to cover the expense of this coverage shall be ($10.00) per month.

Subject to the terms of the policy, MASTER POLICY will extend legal defense to Lessee in the event of actual or alleged liability for bodily injury or property damage not otherwise excluded by the MASTER POLICY. MASTER POLICY is designed to fulfill the insurance requirement of the Lease Agreement.

Scheduling under the MASTER POLICY is not mandatory and Lessee may purchase Required Insurance from an insurance agent or insurance company of Lessee’s choice at any time and coverage under the MASTER POLICY will be immediately terminated.

3. DEFINITION OF SMOKING. Smoking refers to any use or possession of a cigar, cigarette, e-cigarette, hookah, vaporizer, or pipe containing tobacco or a tobacco product while that tobacco or tobacco product is burning, lighted, vaporized, or ignited, regardless of whether the person using or possessing the product is inhaling or exhaling the smoke from such product. The term tobacco includes, but is not limited to any form, compound, or synthesis of the plant of the genus Nicotiana or the species N. tabacum which is cultivated for its leaves to be used in cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes, hookahs, vaporizers, or pipes. Smoking also refers to use or possession of burning, lighted, vaporized, or ignited non-tobacco products if they are noxious, offensive, unsafe, unhealthy, or irritating to other persons.

4. SMOKING ANYWHERE INSIDE BUILDINGS OF THE COMMUNITY IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED. All forms and use of burning, lighted, vaporized, or ignited tobacco products and smoking of tobacco products inside any dwelling, building, or interior of any portion of the community is strictly prohibited. Any violation of the no-smoking policy is a material and substantial violation of this Addendum and the Lease Contract.

The prohibition on use of any burning, lighted, vaporized, or ignited tobacco products or smoking of any tobacco products extends to all residents, their occupants, guests, invitees and all others who are present on or in any portion of the community. The no-smoking policy and rules extend to, but are not limited to, the management and leasing offices, building interiors and hallways, building common areas, dwellings, club house, exercise or spa facility, tennis courts, all interior areas of the community, commercial shops, businesses, and spaces, work areas, and all other spaces whether in the interior of the community or in the enclosed spaces on the surrounding

community grounds. Smoking of non-tobacco products which are harmful to the health, safety, and welfare of other residents inside any dwelling or building is also prohibited by this Addendum and other provisions of the Lease Contract.

5. Smoking Outside Buildings of the Community. Smoking is permitted only in specially designated areas outside the buildings of the community. Smoking must be at least 25 feet from the buildings in the community, including administrative office buildings. If the previous field is not completed, smoking is only permitted at least 25 feet from the buildings in the community, including administrative office buildings. The smoking-permissible areas are marked by signage.

Smoking on balconies, patios, and limited common areas X attached to or outside of your dwelling  is  is not permitted.

The following outside areas of the community may be used for smoking:

Even though smoking may be permitted in certain limited outside areas, we reserve the right to direct that you and your occupants, family, guests, and invitees cease and desist from smoking in those areas if smoke is entering the dwellings or buildings or if it is interfering with the health, safety, or welfare or disturbing the quiet enjoyment, or business operations of us, other residents, or guests.

6. YOUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR DAMAGES AND CLEANING. You are responsible for payment of all costs and damages to your dwelling, other residents’ dwellings, or any other portion of the community for repair, replacement, or cleaning due to smoking or smoke related damage caused by you or your occupants, family, guests, or invitees, regardless of whether such use was a violation of this Addendum.

8. LEASE CONTRACT TERMINATION FOR VIOLATION OF THIS ADDENDUM. We have the right to terminate your Lease Contract or right of occupancy of the dwelling for any violation of this No-Smoking Addendum.

Despite the termination of the Lease Contract or your occupancy, you will remain liable for rent through the end of the Lease Contract term or the date on which the dwelling is re-rented to a new occupant, whichever comes first. Therefore, you may be responsible for payment of rent after you vacate the leased premises even though you are no longer living in the dwelling.

Smoking in certain limited outside areas is allowed as provided above. Enforcement of our no-smoking policy is a joint responsibility which requires your cooperation in reporting incidents or suspected violations of smoking. You must report violations of our no-smoking policy before we are obligated to investigate and act, and you must thereafter cooperate with us in prosecution of such violations.

This is an important and binding legal document. By signing this Addendum you are acknowledging that a violation could lead to termination of your Lease Contract or right to continue living in the dwelling. If you or someone in your household is a smoker, you should carefully consider whether you will be able to abide by the terms of this Addendum.

This Addendum constitutes an Addendum to the above described Lease Contract for the above described premises, and is hereby incorporated into and made a part of such Lease Contract. Where the terms or conditions found in this Addendum vary or contradict any terms or conditions found in the Lease Contract, this Addendum shall control.

3. Under federal law, specifically the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), marijuana is still categorized as a Schedule I substance. This means that under federal law, the manufacture, distribution, or possession of marijuana is strictly prohibited. Because the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is controlled by the federal government, it agrees that the use of marijuana, whether prescribed for medical reasons or not, is a criminal offense and will not be protected under the fair housing laws. Therefore, management is not required to accommodate the use of marijuana by a tenant who is a current recreational and/or medical marijuana user. Disabled tenants who are registered medical marijuana users, however, should not feel discouraged to request reasonable accommodations if the need arises.

4. Smoking refers to any use or possession of a cigar, cigarette, e-cigarette, hookah, vaporizer, or pipe containing either tobacco or a tobacco product or marijuana or a marijuana product, while that tobacco or tobacco product or that marijuana or marijuana product are burning, lighted,

vaporized, or ignited, regardless of whether the person using or possessing said product is inhaling or is exhaling the smoke from such product. The term “tobacco” includes, but is not limited to, any form, compound, or synthesis of the plant of the genus Nicotiana or the species N. tabacum, which is cultivated for its leaves to be used in cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes, hookahs, vaporizers, or pipes. The term "marijuana" includes, but is not limited to, the dried leaves and flowering tops (herbal cannabis), with by-products such as hashish or hash oil. The term "marijuana" further includes, but is not limited to, the whole cannabis plant or any part of it, as well as a portion of the cannabis plant that contains high levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The term “smoking” as used herein will also refer to the use or possession of burning, lighted, vaporized, or ignited non-tobacco or nonmarijuana products, if such use or possession is noxious, offensive, unsafe, unhealthy, and/or irritating to other persons.

5. The Premises listed above follows and complies with federal law regarding marijuana use and is, and will continue to be, a drug free community. Possession, use, manufacture or sale of any illegal substance, including marijuana, or any use of marijuana by the tenant and/or guests will result in immediate termination of your tenancy. If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please speak to management.

Virginia Statement of Tenant Rights and Responsibilities under the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act as of July 1, 2024

This is a summary of tenants’ rights and responsibilities under the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act. This summary does not modify your lease or Virginia law. A lease cannot give up a tenants’ rights under the law. The information below is not intended as legal advice. All parties to a rental agreement are encouraged to consult the Department of Housing and Community Development's website for more information related to landlord and tenant resources. Tenants with questions are encouraged to contact their local legal aid program at (866) 534-5243 or valegalaid.org/find-legal-help.

Tenant Rights

Applications:

Tenants may be charged a nonrefundable application fee of no more than $50 (not including third party costs for a background check) and a refundable application deposit. If the tenant does not rent the unit, the application deposit must be returned, minus any actual costs or damages. (§55.1-1203)

Written lease:

Under the VRLTA, a landlord is required to provide a tenant a written lease. If a landlord fails to do so, the VRLTA still protects a tenant by establishing a statutory lease between landlord and tenant for 12 months not subject to automatic renewal. (§55.1-1204)

Disclosure:

A landlord must reveal certain information to the tenant, including any visible evidence of mold (§55.1-1215), the name and address of the owner or property manager (§55.1-1216), notice of sale or foreclosure of the property (§§55.1-1216, 1237), and on the first page of the lease, the rent and any additional fees. (§55.1-1204.1)

Security Deposit:

A landlord may require a security deposit of up to two monthʼs rent. Within five days of move in the tenant has a right to object to anything in the move-in report. The tenant also has a right to be present at a move-out inspection, which must be made within 72 hours of delivery of possession. (§§55.1-1214, 1226)

Receipts:

Upon request, a tenant is entitled to a written receipt of rent paid by cash or money order. Upon request, a tenant is entitled to a written statement of all charges and payments over the past 12 months. (§55.1-1204(D), (I))

Last Updated July 1, 2024

Privacy:

A landlord may not release information about a tenant without consent, except under certain conditions, which are generally when tenant information is already public. (§55.1-1209)

Fit and Habitable Premises:

A tenant has the right to a fit and habitable rental unit in accordance with the Uniform Statewide Building Code. The landlord must make all repairs needed to keep premises fit and habitable. (§55.1-1220) To enforce the right to get repairs, a tenant must be current in rent, give the landlord written notice of the need for repairs, and give the landlord a reasonable amount of time to make the repairs. If repairs are not made, a tenant can file a Tenantʼs Assertion in General District Court. This must be filed no later than five days after rent is due. There is no rent withholding in Virginia except under repair and deduct (below). (§55.1-1244)

Repair and Deduct:

If an issue on the premises affects life, health, safety, or seriously affects habitability, and a landlord has not begun to address it within 14 days after written notice from the tenant, the tenant may contract to have the repair done by a licensed contractor at a cost of not more than $1,500, or one monthʼs rent, whichever is more. The tenant may deduct the actual cost of the repair from the rent. The tenant must send the landlord an itemized invoice and a receipt for payment to the contractor for the work, along with any payment of remaining rent owed. (§55.1-1244.1)

Uninhabitable Dwelling Unit at Move In:

If, at the beginning of the tenancy, there exists a fire hazard or a serious threat to the life, health or safety of the tenant (such as an infestation of rodents or a lack of heat, hot or cold running water, electricity, or adequate sewage disposal facilities), the tenant may terminate the rental agreement and receive a full refund of all deposits and rent paid to the landlord. To terminate the agreement and request a refund, the tenant must provide a written notice of termination no later than seven days after the tenancy started. If, upon receipt of notice, the landlord agrees such hazardous condition exists, the landlord must refund all deposits and rent paid within 15 business days of being notified or of the tenant vacating the unit, whichever occurs later. (§55.1-1234.1)

The landlord may, in a written notice provided to the tenant, state that the termination is unjustified and refuse to accept the tenant’s termination of the lease. A tenant who has vacated the unit (or never moved in initially) may then challenge the landlord’s refusal in court. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees. (§55.11234.1)

Last Updated July 1, 2024

Notification of Rent Increase:

If a lease contains an option to renew or an automatic renewal provision, a tenant must be notified in writing of a rent increase at least 60 days before the end of the lease term. This only applies when a landlord owns more than four rental units or more than 10% percent interest in more than four rental units in the Commonwealth. (§55.1-1204(K))

Eviction:

A landlord may not evict a tenant without following the court eviction process. The landlord first sends a written notice and next the landlord files an unlawful detainer lawsuit. The landlord must get a court order of possession, followed by a Writ of Eviction that is served by the Sheriff. (§§55.1-1245, 1252). A tenant not getting paid due to a federal shutdown of 14 or more days can get an eviction lawsuit for nonpayment of rent postponed for 60 days. (§44-209)

Unlawful Exclusion, Interruption of Essential Services, and Unlivable Premises:

A Landlord may not unlawfully exclude a tenant from the premises, interrupt an essential service, or make the unit unlivable. If this happens, the tenant may sue the landlord in General District Court and get an initial court hearing within five calendar days. At this hearing, a court may order the landlord to give the property back to the tenant, resume the essential service, or fix the conditions that make the unit unlivable. The court may also hold a second hearing within 10 days of the first hearing and may find that the tenant is entitled to actual damages, statutory damages, and reasonable attorney’s fees. (§55.1-1243.1) If a tenant is excluded from the unit because the unit was condemned, the tenant may sue the landlord for actual damages. The landlord must return any prepaid rent, security deposit, and rent paid after the unit was condemned. (§55.1-1243.2)

Domestic Violence— Right to Change Locks:

If a tenant has obtained an order from a court under §16,1-279.1 (for family abuse) or §20103 (for apprehension of physical harm by a family or household member) that excludes someone else from the premises, the tenant may provide the landlord with a copy of that court order and request that the landlord either install a new lock or other security devices on the exterior doors of the unit or permit the tenant to do so.

The tenant shall provide a duplicate copy of all keys and instructions for the operation of all devices to the landlord. The new lock/security device must not cause permanent damage to the dwelling unit, and the tenant shall be responsible for the cost of installing the lock/security device, reasonable costs incurred to remove the device(s), and all damage upon termination of the lease. (§55.1-1230)

Last Updated July 1, 2024

Domestic Violence—Right to Terminate the Lease:

A tenant who is a victim of family abuse as defined by §16.1-228, sexual abuse as defined by §18.2-67.10, or other criminal sexual assault may terminate their lease if:

1. The tenant has obtained an order of protection under §16.1-279.1 (for family abuse), OR a permanent protective order under §19.2-152.10 (general protective order) against the perpetrator, OR the perpetrator has been convicted of any of the above crimes against the tenant, AND

2. The tenant provides the landlord with a written notice of termination that includes copy of the order of protection or the conviction order.

The lease shall be terminated 30 days after the tenant provides the landlord with the written notice. The rent must be paid at the normal time through the effective date of the termination. (§55.1-1236)

Redemption (Pay & Stay):

After an unlawful detainer lawsuit for nonpayment of rent is filed, a tenant has the right to pay to a zero balance on or before the court date and have the lawsuit dismissed. After a court issues a judgment of possession, a tenant has the right to pay to a zero balance up to 48 hours before the Sheriffs eviction and have the eviction cancelled. If the landlord has 5 or more rentals, a tenant may use these rights at any time. If the landlord has 4 or fewer rentals, the landlord may limit the tenant’s use of these rights to once during the lease period if the landlord first sends a written notice of this limitation. (§55.1-1250)

Fair Housing:

The tenant may have a right to file a fair housing complaint if the landlord or property manager violates the Virginia Fair Housing Act. (§36-96.1 et seq, HUD FHEO-2020-1)

Tenant Responsibilities

Rent:

Unless the lease says otherwise, rent is due in equal payments each month on or before the first of each month. (§55.1-1204)

Late Fees:

If rent is not paid on time, the tenant must pay a late fee only if the lease requires one. A late fee can be no more than 10% of the monthly rent or 10% of the unpaid balance owed by the tenant, whichever is less. (§55.1-1204(E))

Last Updated July 1, 2024

Insurance:

A tenant may be required to have and pay for renters insurance. A tenant also may be required to have and pay for damage insurance and/or a security deposit, but the total of both the damage insurance premiums and the security deposit may not exceed two monthsʼ rent. (§§55.1-1206, 1208)

Access:

A tenant must allow a landlord access to the unit at reasonable times and for practical purposes, such as maintenance, inspection, or to provide services. A tenant must allow access unless the landlords request is unreasonable. Unless impractical due to an emergency, the landlord must give 72-hoursʼ notice of maintenance and must perform the maintenance within 14 days. If the tenant requests maintenance, notice is not required. (§55.1-1229)

Maintain Fit and Habitable Premises:

The tenant must keep the rental unit as clean and safe as conditions allow and in accordance with the Uniform Statewide Building Code. The tenant must promptly notify the landlord of visible mold and use reasonable efforts to prevent moisture and mold. The tenant must promptly notify the landlord of insects or pests and must not be at fault in failing to prevent insects or pests. (§55.1-1227)

Pursuant to Virginia Code §55.1-1206, as amended, Virginia law requires us to make the following disclosures regarding renter’s insurance and renter’s insurance coverage.

We do not maintain insurance to cover your personal property and/or any personal injury and/or any such damages related thereto. Further, we are not responsible to any resident, guest, invitee, or occupant for damage or loss of any personal property or personal injury proximately caused by the following incidents (including but not limited to) fire, smoke, rain, flood, water and pipe leaks, hail, ice, snow, lightning, wind, explosions, earthquakes, interruption of utilities, theft, hurricanes, negligence of other residents, occupants, or invited/uninvited guests, and/or vandalism unless otherwise required by applicable Virginia law.

If you wish to protect your personal property and limit your personal liability, we strongly encourage you to obtain renter’s insurance.

Please note further that (i) we are not responsible for your personal property, and (ii) our insurance coverage does not cover your personal property, and (iii) if you want to protect your personal property, you should obtain renter’s insurance.
