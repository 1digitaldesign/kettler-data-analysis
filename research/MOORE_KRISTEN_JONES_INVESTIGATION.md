## Why This Was Initially Suspicious

2. **Different Business Models:** Real estate sales vs. property management
3. **Different Company Structures:** Single legitimate brokerage vs. 38 shell companies
4. **No Shared Companies:** Long & Foster is not among Skidmore's 38 companies
5. **No Shared Addresses:** Different Virginia locations
6. **No Shared Principal Broker:** D'AMBROSIA vs. Skidmore herself
7. **Legitimate Operation:** Long & Foster is a well-established real estate brokerage with 2,297 licensees

## Conclusion

**MOORE, KRISTEN JONES is a legitimate real estate salesperson operating independently through Long & Foster Real Estate Inc.** Her license's appearance in initial search results was coincidental due to:
- Numerical proximity of license numbers
- Recent licensing date (2025)
- Virginia location

**No further investigation needed.** This individual is not connected to:
- Caitlin Skidmore's 38 property management companies
- The Frisco, TX shell company structure
- Kettler Management operations
- Any fraudulent licensing patterns

## Recommendation

**Document as "False Positive - No Connection"** and exclude from further investigation. Focus remains on:
1. Caitlin Skidmore's 38 property management companies
2. The Frisco, TX shell company structure (6 companies)
3. Kettler Management Inc. operations
4. Edward Hyland's unlicensed practice
