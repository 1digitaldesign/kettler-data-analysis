---

## Implications

### Legal Significance
1. **Distributed Licensing:** Not a single front person, but multiple licensed individuals across different states
2. **State-Specific Licensing:** Each licensed employee appears to be licensed in only one state
3. **Coverage Strategy:** May be attempting to have licensed coverage in multiple states through different individuals
4. **Still Insufficient:** Majority of employees (12/15) remain unlicensed across all states

### Investigation Impact
- **Pattern Changed:** From single front person to distributed multi-state licensing
- **Still Violations:** 87 violations remain - majority of operations unlicensed
- **Strategy Revealed:** Attempting to minimize licensing costs by having only a few employees licensed in specific states
