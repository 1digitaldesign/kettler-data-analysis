- Lower cost approach

**Tier 2: Kettler Own Employees (Maryland Only)**
- Uses Cindy Fisher, Christina Chang (Kettler employees)
- Direct employment model
- Higher cost but more control

**Tier 3: No Coverage (9 States)**
- No licensed brokers found
- Operating without proper coverage
- **VIOLATIONS CONFIRMED**

---

## Conclusion

**Yes, it's still NOT legal.**

**Key Findings:**
1. ✅ **DC:** Compliant (via Lariat)
2. ✅ **Maryland:** Compliant (own employees)
3. ❌ **Virginia:** **VIOLATION** - No licensed coverage (largest operations)
4. ❌ **8 Other States:** **VIOLATIONS** - No licensed coverage

**Compliance Rate:** 18% (2/11 states)
