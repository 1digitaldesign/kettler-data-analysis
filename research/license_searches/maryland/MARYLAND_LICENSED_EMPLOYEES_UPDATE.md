3. **Coverage Strategy:** May be attempting to have licensed coverage in multiple states through different individuals

### Violations Update
- **Maryland Violations:** Reduced from 15 to 13 (2 employees are licensed)
- **Total Violations:** Still significant - majority of employees remain unlicensed
- **Pattern:** Multi-state licensing strategy, but still insufficient coverage
