## WHY: Regulatory Enforcement Relevance

### Public Protection Mandate

**Consumer Protection:**
- Real estate licensing ensures practitioners meet education, examination, and ethical standards
- Unlicensed operations expose consumers to unqualified practitioners
- Violations undermine public trust in regulated real estate markets

**Market Integrity:**
- Licensing requirements maintain professional standards
- Unlicensed operations create unfair competitive advantages
- Violations distort market competition

**Regulatory Compliance:**
- State licensing laws exist to protect public health, safety, and welfare
- Systematic violations indicate intentional non-compliance
- Front person schemes circumvent regulatory oversight

### Compliance Issues

**Systematic Non-Compliance:**
- Pattern indicates intentional avoidance of licensing requirements
- Single licensed employee cannot supervise all operations across multiple states
- Company structure designed to minimize licensing obligations

**Supervision Violations:**
- Licensed principal broker cannot adequately supervise operations in states where unlicensed
- Geographic scope exceeds reasonable supervision capacity
- Multiple unlicensed employees operating independently

**Corporate Responsibility:**
- Company leadership (CEO, President) operating without licenses
- Executive team demonstrates disregard for regulatory requirements
- Pattern suggests corporate policy of non-compliance
