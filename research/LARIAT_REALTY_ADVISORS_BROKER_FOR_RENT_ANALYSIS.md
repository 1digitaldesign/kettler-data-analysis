## Business Model Analysis

### "Broker for Rent" Pattern

**How It Works:**
1. Property management companies need licensed brokers to operate legally in each state
2. Instead of hiring full-time licensed brokers, companies contract with Lariat Realty Advisors
3. Lariat provides licensed brokers (like Caitlin Skidmore) who are "affiliated" with multiple property management companies
4. The broker's license covers the property management company's operations in that state

**Evidence from DC License Search:**
- Caitlin Skidmore is affiliated with **24 property management companies** in DC
- This includes **KETTLER MANAGEMENT INC**
- All companies share the same principal broker (Caitlin Skidmore)

---

## Implications for Kettler Management Investigation

### 1. Licensing Strategy Revealed

**Pattern Identified:**
- Kettler uses Lariat Realty Advisors as their "broker for rent" service
- Caitlin Skidmore serves as the licensed broker for Kettler in DC
- This allows Kettler to operate in DC without having their own licensed employees

### 2. Multi-State Operations Without Proper Licensing

**Kettler's Operational States:**
- **10 current states:** VA, DC, MD, PA, NC, SC, GA, FL, AZ, NM, UT
- **2025 expansion:** AZ, NM, UT

**Lariat Coverage:**
- Lariat claims to provide broker services in **46 states + DC**
- This includes all of Kettler's operational states

**⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING:**
- **DC:** Kettler uses Lariat broker (Caitlin Skidmore)
- **Maryland:** Kettler uses their OWN employees (Cindy Fisher, Christina Chang) - NOT Lariat
- **Other States:** Unknown if Kettler uses Lariat or has their own licensed employees

**Question:** Is Kettler using Lariat's broker services in states beyond DC, or do they have their own licensed employees in other states?

### 3. Unlicensed Co-Brokers

**Finding:**
- Liddy Bisanz and Leah Douthit are listed as brokers at Lariat Realty Advisors
- **Both are unlicensed** in all states searched
- This suggests they may be operating under Caitlin Skidmore's license or falsely representing themselves as licensed brokers

### 4. Violation Potential

**Potential Violations:**
1. **Unlicensed Practice:** If Liddy Bisanz or Leah Douthit are performing broker activities without licenses
2. **False Representation:** If they are representing themselves as licensed brokers when they are not
3. **Improper Supervision:** If Caitlin Skidmore is not properly supervising operations in states where she is not licensed
4. **Multi-State Operations:** If Kettler is operating in states where they don't have proper broker coverage

## Comparison: Licensed vs. Unlicensed Pattern

### Licensed Employees

**Lariat Realty Advisors Brokers:**
- **Caitlin Skidmore:** DC only (via Lariat) - NOT licensed in Maryland

**Kettler Management Employees (NOT Lariat):**
- **Cindy Fisher:** Maryland only (Kettler employee)
- **Christina Chang:** Maryland only (Kettler employee)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:** Cindy Fisher and Christina Chang are Kettler employees, NOT Lariat Realty Advisors brokers. The Lariat "broker for rent" operation has NO licensed brokers in Maryland.

### Unlicensed "Brokers" (Lariat)
- **Liddy Bisanz:** Unlicensed in all 14 states searched
- **Leah Douthit:** Unlicensed in all 12 states searched

**Pattern:** Only Caitlin Skidmore is licensed (DC), while her co-brokers at Lariat are unlicensed.

## Regulatory Concerns

### 1. Broker Supervision Requirements
- Most states require licensed brokers to supervise real estate activities
- If Liddy Bisanz and Leah Douthit are performing broker activities, they must be supervised by a licensed broker
- Question: Who is supervising their activities in states where Caitlin Skidmore is not licensed?

### 2. Multi-State Licensing
- Real estate licenses are state-specific
- A DC license does not authorize practice in other states
- If Lariat is providing "broker services" in 46 states, they need licensed brokers in each state

### 3. Affiliated Company Requirements
- States typically require brokers to be properly affiliated with companies
- Having 24 affiliated companies (as Caitlin Skidmore does) may violate supervision requirements
- Question: Can one broker properly supervise 24 property management companies?

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Verify Lariat's Licensed Brokers
- Search for licensed brokers at Lariat Realty Advisors in each state where they claim to operate
- Verify that Caitlin Skidmore, Liddy Bisanz, and Leah Douthit are properly licensed in states where they operate

### 2. Investigate Kettler's Use of Lariat Services
- Determine if Kettler is using Lariat's broker services in states beyond DC
- Verify that Kettler has proper broker coverage in all operational states

### 3. Review State Regulations
- Check each state's requirements for broker supervision
- Verify compliance with multi-state broker affiliation rules

### 4. Document Violations
- Document any instances where unlicensed individuals are performing broker activities
- Document any improper supervision or affiliation violations
