## Two-Tier Licensing Strategy

### Tier 1: Lariat Realty Advisors (DC Only)
- **State:** District of Columbia
- **Broker:** Caitlin Skidmore (Lariat)
- **Model:** "Broker for rent" service
- **Coverage:** DC only
- **Cost:** Likely lower (shared broker service)

### Tier 2: Kettler Own Employees (Maryland)
- **State:** Maryland
- **Brokers:** Cindy Fisher, Christina Chang (Kettler employees)
- **Model:** Direct employment with licensed staff
- **Coverage:** Maryland only
- **Cost:** Likely higher (full-time employees)

---

## Implications

### 1. Strategic Decision
**Why use different strategies?**
- **DC:** May be cheaper/more convenient to use Lariat's shared broker service
- **Maryland:** May require more direct control or Lariat doesn't have licensed brokers there

### 2. Regulatory Compliance
- **DC:** Compliant through Lariat broker (Caitlin Skidmore)
- **Maryland:** Compliant through own employees (Cindy Fisher, Christina Chang)
- **Other States:** Unknown - may be non-compliant if operating without proper broker coverage

### 3. Operational Risk
- **DC:** Dependent on Lariat Realty Advisors for compliance
- **Maryland:** Direct control through own employees
- **Risk:** If Lariat loses license or Caitlin Skidmore leaves, DC operations could be at risk

### 4. Cost Structure
- **DC:** Lower cost (shared broker service)
- **Maryland:** Higher cost (full-time licensed employees)
- **Question:** Why the difference? Regulatory requirements? Business strategy?

## Pattern Analysis

### Licensed Coverage by State

| State | Strategy | Licensed Broker(s) | Source |
|-------|----------|-------------------|--------|

---

## Questions for Further Investigation

1. **Why different strategies?**
   - Regulatory differences between DC and Maryland?
   - Cost considerations?
   - Availability of Lariat brokers?

2. **Other states:**
   - Does Kettler use Lariat brokers in other states?
   - Do they have their own licensed employees in other states?
   - Are they operating without proper broker coverage?

3. **Lariat's Maryland operations:**
   - Why doesn't Lariat have licensed brokers in Maryland?
   - Do they provide broker services in Maryland through other brokers?
   - Is Maryland a gap in Lariat's coverage?

---

## Violations Potential

### States with No Licensed Coverage Found

**Virginia:**
- No licensed employees found
- No Lariat broker coverage confirmed
- **Risk:** Operating without proper broker coverage

**Other Operational States:**
- Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida
- Arizona, New Mexico, Utah (2025 expansion)
- **Risk:** May be operating without proper broker coverage

---

## Conclusion

**Kettler Management uses a hybrid licensing strategy:**
- **DC:** Outsourced to Lariat Realty Advisors (Caitlin Skidmore)
- **Maryland:** In-house licensed employees (Cindy Fisher, Christina Chang)

**Critical Finding:** None of the Lariat Realty Advisors brokers are licensed in Maryland. Kettler maintains their own licensed employees in Maryland, separate from the Lariat "broker for rent" operation.

**This suggests:**
1. Lariat may not provide adequate coverage in Maryland
2. Kettler may need more direct control in Maryland
3. Different states may require different licensing strategies
4. Other states may have compliance gaps
