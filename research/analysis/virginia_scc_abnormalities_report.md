- **Business Address:** 8255 Greensboro Dr Ste 200, McLean, VA, 22102-4944, USA

## Abnormalities Identified

### 1. Name Inconsistency (Medium Severity)

**Finding:** Single entity (03218674) is registered with two different names:
- Legal Name: "KETTLER MANAGEMENT INC."
- Fictitious Name/DBA: "Kettler Management Corp."

**Issue:** The fictitious name uses "Corp." instead of "Inc.", creating potential confusion.

**Implications:**
- Potential confusion for consumers/regulators about exact legal entity name
- May indicate intentional name variation for business purposes
- Could be used to obscure connection between entities

**Regulatory Concerns:**
- Virginia requires disclosure of legal entity name in business transactions
- Real estate licensing may require use of exact legal entity name
- Contracts should reference legal entity name

**Recommendation:** Verify if "Kettler Management Corp." is properly registered as a DBA/fictitious name and if it's being used in operations. Check if proper disclosure of legal entity name is occurring in all business transactions.

### 2. Missing Detailed Filing Information (Medium Severity)

**Finding:** Initial search did not capture:
- Formation date
- Last annual report date
- Officers/directors information
- Filing history/amendments

**Implications:**
- Cannot determine when entity was formed
- Cannot verify current officers/directors
- Cannot confirm annual report filing compliance
- Cannot review filing history for changes

**Recommendation:** Access detailed entity record (click Entity ID 03218674) to obtain:
- Formation date
- Annual report dates
- Officers/directors list
- Any amendments or name changes
- Filing compliance history

### 3. Registered Agent (Low Severity)

**Finding:** Uses commercial registered agent service (NATIONAL REGISTERED AGENTS, INC.) instead of in-house registered agent.

**Assessment:** This is standard business practice and not an abnormality. However, it may make it harder to identify actual business location.

**Recommendation:** No action needed - this is standard business practice.

### 4. Address Consistency (Low Severity)

**Finding:** Both names share identical business address: 8255 Greensboro Dr Ste 200, McLean, VA.

**Assessment:** Consistent address suggests legitimate DBA registration. Address matches known Kettler operations location.

**Recommendation:** Verify this address matches actual business operations.

### 5. Entity Type (Low Severity)

**Finding:** Registered as "Stock Corporation" - standard for for-profit business entities.

**Assessment:** Standard entity type for property management companies. Allows for stock issuance and corporate structure.

**Recommendation:** No abnormality - standard registration.

### 6. Status (Low Severity)

**Finding:** Status is "Active" - entity is in good standing.

**Assessment:** Entity is current with Virginia SCC requirements. No administrative dissolution or revocation.

**Recommendation:** Monitor for any status changes.

## Potential Concerns

### Concern 1: Name Variation Usage

If "Kettler Management Corp." (fictitious name) is being used in business operations, contracts, or licensing without proper disclosure of the legal entity name "KETTLER MANAGEMENT INC.", this could be a violation.

**Regulatory Implications:**
- Virginia requires disclosure of legal entity name in business transactions
- Real estate licensing may require use of exact legal entity name
- Contracts should reference legal entity name

### Concern 2: Multi-State Registration

Need to verify if this entity is properly registered in other states where Kettler operates (MD, DC, CT, NJ, NY, etc.).

**Regulatory Implications:**
- Foreign qualification required in states where business is conducted
- Failure to qualify can result in penalties and inability to sue in state courts
