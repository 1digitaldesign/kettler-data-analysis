### 3. Lariat Realty Advisors - Unlicensed Brokers ⚠️ **VIOLATION**

**Unlicensed "Brokers" at Lariat:**
- **Liddy Bisanz:** Unlicensed in all 14 states searched
- **Leah Douthit:** Unlicensed in all 12 states searched
- **Thomas Bisanz:** Unlicensed in all 14 states searched

**Violation:** If these individuals are:
- Representing themselves as licensed brokers
- Performing broker activities without licenses
- Operating under Caitlin Skidmore's license without proper supervision

**This is a violation** of state real estate commission regulations.

---

### 4. Supervision Violations ⚠️ **POTENTIAL VIOLATION**

**Caitlin Skidmore's DC License:**
- **Affiliated with:** 24 property management companies
- **Includes:** KETTLER MANAGEMENT INC

**Question:** Can one broker properly supervise 24 companies?

**Most states require:**
- Active supervision of all activities
- Physical presence or regular oversight
- Proper record-keeping and compliance

**Violation Risk:** If Caitlin Skidmore cannot properly supervise all 24 companies, this violates broker supervision requirements.

---

### 5. Multi-State Operations Without Proper Coverage ⚠️ **VIOLATION**

**Pattern:**
- **DC:** Licensed (via Lariat)
- **Maryland:** Licensed (own employees)
- **Virginia:** NOT licensed ⚠️
- **Other States:** Unknown

**Legal Requirement:**
- Real estate licenses are **state-specific**
- A DC license does NOT authorize practice in Virginia
- A Maryland license does NOT authorize practice in Virginia
- Each state requires its own license

**Violation:** Operating in Virginia without a Virginia-licensed broker is **illegal**.

---

---

## Why It's Still Illegal

### 1. State-Specific Licensing Requirements

**Key Point:** Real estate licenses are **NOT transferable** between states.

- **DC License:** Only valid in DC
- **Maryland License:** Only valid in Maryland
- **Virginia Operations:** Require Virginia-licensed broker

**Kettler's Situation:**
- ✅ Licensed in DC (Caitlin Skidmore via Lariat)
- ✅ Licensed in Maryland (Cindy Fisher, Christina Chang)
- ❌ **NOT licensed in Virginia** (primary operational state)

**Result:** Operating illegally in Virginia.

---

### 2. Unlicensed Practice

**Edward Hyland:**
- **Role:** Senior Regional Manager
- **Activities:** Property management, lease decisions, tenant relations
- **License Status:** CONFIRMED UNLICENSED in Virginia
- **Violation:** Unlicensed practice of real estate

**Legal Requirement:** These activities require a real estate license in Virginia.

---

### 3. Broker Supervision Requirements

**Even if licensed in some states:**
- Each state has its own supervision requirements
- Brokers must actively supervise activities
- Cannot supervise operations in states where not licensed

**Kettler's Issue:**
- Caitlin Skidmore (DC license) cannot supervise Virginia operations
- Cindy Fisher/Christina Chang (MD licenses) cannot supervise Virginia operations
- **Result:** No proper supervision in Virginia

---

## Regulatory Actions Required

### 1. Virginia DPOR Investigation
- **Agency:** Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation (DPOR)
- **Violation:** Unlicensed practice of real estate
- **Evidence:** Edward Hyland operations, no licensed brokers found
- **Action:** File complaint with DPOR

### 2. State Real Estate Commissions
- **States:** PA, NC, SC, GA, FL, AZ, NM, UT
- **Action:** Verify licensed broker coverage in each state
- **Risk:** Potential violations if operating without coverage

### 3. Lariat Realty Advisors Investigation
- **Agency:** DC Real Estate Commission, state commissions
- **Violation:** Unlicensed brokers representing as licensed
- **Action:** Investigate Liddy Bisanz, Leah Douthit, Thomas Bisanz activities

---

## Conclusion

**Yes, it's still NOT legal.**

**Key Violations:**
1. ✅ **Virginia:** Operating without licensed broker coverage (CONFIRMED)
2. ⚠️ **Other States:** Unknown coverage - potential violations
3. ⚠️ **Lariat Brokers:** Unlicensed individuals may be performing broker activities
4. ⚠️ **Supervision:** Questions about proper supervision across states

**Legal Status:**
- **DC:** Compliant (via Lariat)
- **Maryland:** Compliant (own employees)
- **Virginia:** **NON-COMPLIANT** ⚠️
- **Other States:** **UNKNOWN - HIGH RISK** ⚠️

**Bottom Line:** Having licensed employees in DC and Maryland does NOT make operations legal in Virginia or other states. Each state requires its own licensed broker coverage.
